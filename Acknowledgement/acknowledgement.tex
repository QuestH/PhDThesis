Thanks also to my colleagues at AVL List GmbH, for guidance and support.

My loving thanks go to family and friends, for their continued support throughout this endeavour. Thank you to my parents for their unwavering and constant encouragement. To my partner, Kate; your patience, strength and love has made the final steps of this journey possible.
