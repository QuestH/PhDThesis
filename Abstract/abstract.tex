Roller bearings are critical components in hybrid and electric vehicle powertrains. They are often performance limiting, introducing NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness), tribological and wear challenges. The high-speed and varying load conditions of modern electric powertrains necessitates accurate modelling of the bearings to ensure satisfactory system performance and durability. Furthermore, with a push towards achieving zero-prototype development, the use of advanced simulation tools to accurately predict their behaviour at both component and system level is becoming more prevalent.

This work presents a coupled tribological and dynamic approach to modelling high-speed rolling element bearings. Initial experimental work highlights the requirement to model the elastohydrodynamic film at the roller-race contact for future high-speed dynamic modelling.
Flexible multi-body environment. The accuracy of regressed equations for high-speed film thickness predictions is assessed, and an alternate approach using implicit analytical neural networks is presented.
