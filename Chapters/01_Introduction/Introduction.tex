\chapter{Introduction} \label{Introduction}

The automotive industry is transitioning into the next phase of powertrain technology. As automotive manufacturers are forced to meet tightening fleet-wide emissions regulations, the electrified vehicle market share is increasing. The European Union (EU) has established ambitious policy \cite{EUL110/5}, mandating that all new cars and vans sold in Europe be zero-emission by 2035 as part of a broader strategy to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The EU aims to have electrified vehicles - both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) - make up 80 \% of its automotive market share by 2030. In China, government subsidies and investment in battery technology is also yielding a rapid advancement in electrified vehicle adoption - primarily in the passenger car segment. Whilst the direction of the industry remains susceptible to geopolitical and market influences, it is clear that future powertrains will rely on electrification.

To achieve high-efficiency and adhere to packaging constraints, modern electrified powertrains utilize ultra-high speed and low load motors \cite{Cai2021}. These motors introduce new challenges regarding NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) and the tribology of interacting conjunctions. The compact, lightweight and efficient motors operate under significantly different working conditions and are subject to different underlying physics; such as regime of lubrication, dynamic response and magneto-mechanical interactions. This style of powertrain architecture therefore involves high-speed rolling element bearing operation in both the motor and transmission.

These bearings are crucial structural components and their dynamic response significantly affects the behaviour of the interconnected structures. The dynamic behaviour of the bearing prevails the force transmission from the excitation source to the housing and structure. This dynamic behaviour also influences the tribological contact conditions between rollers and raceways.

With a trend towards cost saving zero-prototype development, the use of simulation tools in modern powertrain development is growing. Multi-system vehicle powertrain concepts are pushing complexity of simulation models and this requires accurate and robust component level understanding. Performance characteristics of the bearings, such as NVH, friction, and wear must be accurately modelled at the development stage to ensure full system success.


\section{Research Questions} \label{Research Questions}

The primary objective of this work is to investigate the interaction between tribology and dynamics in rolling element bearings, with particular focus on the significance of this multi-physics interaction in high-speed automotive applications. Specifically, this work examines the influence of the elastohydrodynamic (EHL) film, and assesses the necessity of its implicit inclusion in dynamic bearing modelling. Computational viability of this coupled approach is assessed, and the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) is evaluated to address the accuracy requirements of the numerical EHL solution. This overarching aim is addressed through the following research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How does the EHL film affect the contact stiffness of rolling element bearings in electrified vehicle powertrains?
	\item How considerable is implicit consideration of the EHL film on the dynamic behaviour of bearings in these powertrains?
	\item Can an artificial neural network be used to predict film thickness across a broad range of rolling element bearing input parameters?
	\item Can the ANN be employed implicitly within an flexible multi-body dynamic to compute film thickness to the acuracy of the numerical solution without the computational efficiency limitations? 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Structure of Thesis} \label{Structure of Thesis}

The research in this thesis is presented in the following structure:

\paragraph{Chapter 1} introduces the topic of the thesis and provides the specific research questions that the work aims to answer.

\paragraph{Chapter 2} provides a review of the literature pertinent to the thesis topic, as well as covering the necessary principles required to address the research questions.

\paragraph{Chapter 3} presents a high-speed experimental test rig which was used to obtain kinematic boundary conditions for tribological models. The importance of including the lubricant film in high-speed dynamic bearing models is assessed here. The governing equations for the thesis are also introduced in this chapter.

\paragraph{Chapter 4} integrates the tribological models used in Chapter 3 into a system-level FMBD model. High-speed simulations are performed with operating conditions representative of those in an electrified transmission. The EHL film is modelled implicitly at the roller-race conjunction, and its affect on system dynamics is evaluated.

\paragraph{Chapter 5} introduces an ANN  to address the shortcomings of the analytical approach when estimating EHL film thickness at high speeds. The ANN is trained using a wide design space of input variables. The accuracy of the model and computational efficiency is assessed. The ANN is embedded within the dynamic system level model from Chapter 4 as an alternative approach to the analytical solution for film thickness. 

\paragraph{Chapter 6} presents the general conclusions of the work, and outlines potential future work that could succeed this research.
