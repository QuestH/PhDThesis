\section{Overall Conclusions}

The following conclusions have been drawn from this body of work:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Elastohydrodynamic film thickness shown to increase considerably at the higher entrainment velocities in modern electrified powertrains. System level modelling at 21~000~$rpm$, 
	\item 
	\item FMBD stiffness
	\item ANN accuracy
	\item ANN computational efficiency
	\item ANN implict FMBD
\end{enumerate}

\section{Future Work}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop first stage analysis for which regimes it is required to implictly include the film. Kinematic inputs
	\item Extend the ANN training data to 
	\item Full system level model with multiple lubricated bearings
	\item Develop methodology for ANN in FMBD software
	\item Physics informed Artificial Neural Networks
\end{itemize}
