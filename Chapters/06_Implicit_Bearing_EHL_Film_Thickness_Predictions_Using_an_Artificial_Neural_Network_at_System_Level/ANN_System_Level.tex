\chapter{Implicit Bearing EHL Film Thickness Predictions Using an Artificial Neural Network at System Level}
\label{ANN System Level}



Refer to literature that suggests inclusion of ANN in multibodyu dynamics (Marian, Walker)

Explain findings of previous chapter


Different viscosities and operating points

Higher speeds

Comparisons with analytical equations


Operating points to test:

21 000 rpm

low viscosity 

difference in stiffness

timing of each run for 2 cycles in steady state region
