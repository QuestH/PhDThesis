   abstract = {© 2015, Copyright © Society of Tribologists and Lubrication Engineers. When a ball bearing is designed with thin rings or is mounted in a flexible housing, the assumption of rigid rings is not true anymore. In this article, an experimental study is presented and a comparison with a numerical model is performed. The numerical approach is based on the coupling between a semi-analytical code and a finite element (FE) model that computes the deformation of the rings and housings. The numerical model accounts for ring ovalization, raceway opening, change of conformity, and structural displacements of the whole assembly. The experimental setup allows investigation of the load–displacement behavior of a four-point contact ball bearing submitted to a static thrust loading. Displacements are measured by an optical method (stereo-correlation) that enables comparison of the surface deformation of the two tested bearings and computation of the rigid-body displacement of the inner ring with respect to the outer ring. A comparison between experimental results, numerical results, with and without consideration of ring and housing stiffness, is presented. The numerical results show the importance of the housing stiffness in the modeling, even with standard ball bearings with relatively large and thick rings. Good agreement between measured quantities and numerical results was found. This permits the prediction of the real nonlinear bearing stiffness (load–displacement curve) with a reasonable margin of error.},

   abstract = {Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL) is commonly known as a mode of fluid-film lubrication in which the mechanism of hydrodynamic film formation is enhanced by surface elastic deformation and lubricant viscosity increase due to high pressure. It has been an active and challenging field of research since the 1950s. Significant breakthroughs achieved in the last 10–15 years are largely in the area of mixed EHL, in which surface asperity contact and hydrodynamic lubricant film coexist. Mixed EHL is of the utmost importance not only because most power-transmitting components operate in this regime, but also due to its theoretical universality that dry contact and full-film lubrication are in fact its special cases under extreme conditions. In principle, mixed EHL has included the basic physical elements for modeling contact, or hydrodynamic lubrication, or both together. The unified mixed lubrication models that have recently been developed are now capable of simulating the entire transition of interfacial status from full-film and mixed lubrication down to dry contact with an integrated mathematic formulation and numerical approach. This has indeed bridged the two branches of engineering science, contact mechanics, and hydrodynamic lubrication theory, which have been traditionally separate since the 1880s mainly due to the lack of powerful analytical and numerical tools. The recent advancement in mixed EHL begins to bring contact and lubrication together, and thus an evolving concept of “Interfacial Mechanics” can be proposed in order to describe interfacial phenomena more precisely and collaborate with research in other related fields, such as interfacial physics and chemistry, more closely. This review paper briefly presents snapshots of the history of EHL research, and also expresses the authors’ opinions about its further development as a gateway to interfacial mechanics.},

   abstract = {In many applications, such as four-point contact slewing bearings or main shaft angular contact ball bearings, the rings and housings are so thin that the assumption of rigid rings does not hold anymore. In this paper, several methods are proposed to account for the flexibility of rings in a quasi-static ball bearing numerical model. The modeling approach consists of coupling a semianalytical approach and a finite element (FE) model to describe the deformation of the rings and housings. The manner in which this weak coupling is made differs depending on how the structural deformation of the ring and housing assemblies is injected into the set of nonlinear geometrical and equilibrium equations in order to solve them. These methods enable us to account for ring ovalization, ring twist, and raceway opening (including change of conformity) since a tulip deformation mode of the ring groove is observed for high contact angles. Either the torus fitting technique or mean displacement computation are used to determine these geometrical parameters. A comparison between the different approaches allows us to study, in particular, the impact of raceway conformity change. The loads used in this investigation are chosen in order that the maximum contact pressure (the Hertz pressure) at the ballraceway interface remains below 2000 MPa, without any contact ellipse truncation. For the ball bearing example considered here, relative differences of up to 30% on the axial displacement, 10% on the maximum contact pressure, and 10% on the contact angle are observed by comparing rigid and deformable rings for a typical loading representative of the one encountered in operation. Despite the local change of conformity, which becomes significant at high contact angles and for thin ball bearing flanges, it is shown that this hardly affects the internal load distribution. The paper ends with a discussion on how the ring and housing flexibility may affect the loading envelope when the truncation of the contact ellipse is an issue. Copyright ©2013 by ASME.},

It may cause significant changes in dynamics characteristics, bearing deflections, contact stresses, and fatigue endurance, especially under heavy applied load, large size bearing, hollowed shaft and nonrigid bearing housing. The purpose in the work presented is to research a new approach and multibody model of bearing rings for MBS of mechanical system with rolling bearings. The flexibility and three-dimensional multibody model of bearing rings have been developed using equivalent rigid elements and curved Timoshenko beam elements. The simulation of the bearing rings vibration response will be presented. In addition to the presented multibody model, the FEM model and analytical model are also used to perform the vibration analyses of the bearing ring. An investigation of the actual static deformation field of the outer ring loaded by 5 balls has been carried out for the radial displacement field using the presented model. The total number of the discrete equivalent rigid elements and CTB elements has an important effect on the predicted frequencies, however the results will be minimal changes when the elements are achieved a certain number. In such situations, the presented approach can provide multibody rings model for contact dynamics of rolling bearings with acceptable accuracy and considerably less computational effort. The calculated radial static deformation is critical to load distribution, life fatigue and dynamics characteristics of rolling bearings. The three-dimensional multibody model of bearing rings developed here and the predicted frequencies agree well with the analytical results and FEM. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

An analytical model has been developed using the continuum theory of Griffith to determine energy per unit area required for the development of craters on the track surfaces. Also, an expression is deduced for the net energy transmitted per unit area on the track surfaces by the leakage of stored charge energy resulting in the appearance of craters under the effect of shaft voltage and bearing capacitance depending on operational and dimensional parameters of a bearing in a given span of operation. By the formulation of capacitive stored energy in a bearing using high resistivity lubricant, along with the developed model and expressions using the ratio of cycles to accumulate and discharge of the accumulated charge energy at the various levels of bearing to shaft voltage, the time span/cycles for the appearance of craters of specified dimensions by spark erosion has been determined. Matching time span/cycles has been ascertained by the investigation of a case history of the diagnosis of bearings that failed by crater formation. The analysis can also be used for determination of shaft voltage if the time span/cycles for the formation of known size craters and bearing capacitance are established.},

A combined surface integral and finite element method is used to solve for the contact mechanics between the rolling elements and races. This model captures the time-dependent characteristics of the bearing contact due to the orbital motion of the rolling elements. A numerical method is developed to determine the full bearing stiffness matrix corresponding to two radial, one axial, and two angular coordinates; the rotation about the shaft axis is free by design.

   abstract = {Current bearing models, based on either ideal boundary condition or purely translational stiffness element description, cannot explain how the vibratory motion may be transmitted from the rotating shaft to the casing and other connecting structures in rotating mechanical equipment. For example, a vibration model of a rotating system based upon the existing bearing models can predict only the purely in-plane type motion on the flexible casing plate given only the bending motion on the shaft. However, experimental results have shown that the casing plate motion is primarily flexural or out-of-plane type. In this paper this issue is claridied quantitatively and qualitatively by developing a new mathematical model for the precision rolling element bearings from basic principles. A comprehensive bearing stiffness matrix [K]bm of dimension six is proposed which clearly demonstrates a coupling between the shaft bending motion and the flexural motion on the casing plate. A numerical scheme which involves a solution of non-linear algebraic equations is proposed for the estimation of the stiffness coefficients given the mean bearing load vector. A second method which requires the direct evaluation of these stiffness coefficients given the mean bearing displacement vector is also discussed. Some of the translational stiffness coefficients of the proposed bearing matrix have been verified by using available analytical and experimental data. Further validation of [K]bm is not possible as coupling coefficients are never measured. Also, parametric studies on the effect of unloaded contact angle, preload or bearing type are included. These results lead to a complete characterization of the bearing stiffness matrix. The theory is used to analyze vibration transmission properties in the companion paper, Part II. © 1990.},

   abstract = {Gear trains applied to automotive transmissions and combustion engines are potential excitation sources of undesired whine noise. Consequently, the prediction of gear whine issues in an early stage of the product development process is strongly requested. Beside the actual excitation mechanism which is closely related to the gear's transmission error, the vibratory behavior (e.g. resonances) of other affected components like shafts, bearings and housing plays an important role in terms of structure borne noise transfer. The paper deals with gear contact models of different degree of detail, which are embedded in a multi-body dynamics (MBD) environment. Since gear meshing frequency and their harmonics may easily reach up to 5 kHz or even 10 kHz, applied gear contact models must be highly efficient with respect to calculation performance. Otherwise, major requirements of the development process in terms of process time can not be satisfied as is the case with FEA-based contact models. Models are developed for spur and helical gears, containing contact point search and force calculation. Tooth deformations are covered as well as friction forces. Resolution of contact is preliminary based on the ideal tooth geometry, deviations from the ideal geometry caused by shape modifications and manufacturing tolerances are considered in a subsequent step. In order to cover edge loading effects the approach reflects gear misalignment, too. A comparison to experimental data for a two gear stage test-rig is performed across the engine speed range. It turned out that the knowledge of the detailed flank geometry is the major prerequisite for a reliable prediction of gear whine excitation and transmission error.

Linear time-invariant, discrete dynamic models of a generic geared rotor system with proportional viscous damping are developed, by using lumped parameter and dynamic finite element techniques, which are then used to predict the vibration transmissibility through bearings and mounts, casing vibration motion, and dynamic response of the internal rotating system. Each rotating shaft is modeled as an Euler beam in the lumped parameter model and as a Timoshenko beam in the dynamic finite element model, but the gyroscopic moment is not included. Eigensolution and forced harmonic response studies due to rotating mass unbalance or kinematic transmission error excitation for the following example cases are obtained by using the formulation, and the results are compared with those of simple models currently available in the literature and/or experiment: case I, a single-stage rotor system with flexibly mounted rigid casing consisting of two bearings as a special case of the geared rotor system; case II, a spur gear pair drive supported by four bearings installed in a flexibly mounted rigid casing; and case III, an experimental set-up consisting of a high-precision gear and pinion, and four identical rolling element bearings contained in a flexible casing mounted rigidly on a massive foundation. Analytical predictions show that the theory is indeed capable of predicting bearing and mount moment transmissibilities in addition to the force transmissibilities. Also, flexural vibrations of the casing plate are predicted well as the theory is in good agreement with measurements made on case III; such predictions are not provided by simple models due to inadequate bearing formulation. © 1991.},

The non-linearity in the rotor bearing system has been considered mainly due to Hertzian contact, unbalanced rotor effect and radial internal clearance. This is modeled as an oscillating spring-mass-damper system. Various techniques like Time Response curves, PoincarÁ maps, Orbits plots, fast Fourier transformation, Hopf bifurcation and Phase Trajectory are used to study the nature of response. The motion of an unbalanced rotor is categorized with respect to the ratio of the Forcing/Natural frequency of the system as Harmonic, Sub-harmonic, Quasi periodic and Chaotic. The results show the appearance of instability and chaos in the dynamic response as the speed of the rotor-bearing system is changed. Period doubling and mechanism of intermittency have been observed that lead to chaos. The outcomes illustrate the appearance of instability and chaos in the dynamic response as the speed of the rotor-bearing system is changed.

   abstract = {Skidding which occurs in high speed roller bearings frequently causes wear and incipient failure of bearing inner ring and roller surfaces. To eliminate skidding, aircraft gas turbine designers, historically, have employed out-of-round outer rings and other preloading devices. Prior to testing of the full-scale bearings at engine speeds, however, the designers have not, heretofore, been able to determine (a) the extent of skidding which occurs and (b) the effectiveness of means employed to eliminate skidding. The analytical method which is presented by this discussion is based upon recently developed elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory and can be used in lieu of expensive testing procedures to adequately predict bearing cage speed, and therefore the extent of skidding, under any condition of radial load and shaft speed. Moreover, the analysis can be used to determine how much radial preloading or outer ring out-of-roundness is necessary to minimize skidding. The analytical data of this study are compare...},

In practice, rotors can never be balanced perfectly owing to manufacturing errors such as porosity in casting, non-uniform density of materials, manufacturing tolerances, and gain or loss of material during operation. Mass imbalance leads to the generation of a centrifugal force, which must be counteracted by bearings and support structures. A full spectrum analysis is presented for vibration signal to reveal the fault specific whirl signatures. The results clearly indicate the potential and feasibility of the discussed approach for the rotor imbalance diagnosis in a rotor shaft system coupled with a three phase induction motor. This paper presents a smart experimental method for vibration measurement and imbalance fault detection in rotating machinery.},

A new numerical integral method that combines the Newmark-β method and the improved Newmark-β method (Zhai method) is used to obtain the system responses. Finally, the new model is verified in three ways: (1) modal experiment based on rotor-ball bearing rig, (2) modal experiment based on rotor-ball-bearing-casing rig, and (3) fault simulations for a certain type of missile turbofan aero-engine vibration. The results show that the proposed model can not only simulate the natural vibration characteristics of the whole aero-engine but also effectively perform nonlinear dynamic simulations of a whole aero-engine with faults.},

   abstract = {Angular contact ball bearings are the most popular bearing type used in the high speed spindle for machining centers. Because the bearing load is increased rapidly with the raised spindle speed due to the centrifugal force and temperature raise, proper initial preload and especially operating-induced load control of the angular ball bearing is important to the rigidity, accuracy and life of the spindle. The bearing layout, preload mechanism an on-line load bearing control are discussed in this paper. The management of the centrifugal force and thermally-induced bearing loads is especially emphasized. An active bearing load monitoring and control mechanism that consists of an integrated strain-gage load cells and piezoelectric actuators has been developed and tested. This active control and monitoring mechanism on-line adjusts the bearing load according the cutting conditions. Experiments were conducted to identify the proper initial bearing preload range. Optimal preload for the lowest bearing temperature raise existed for a specified spindle speed. The optimum preload, however, should be raised when the operational speed is increased. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {In this work, an eight-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model of the gear-shaft-bearing-housing system is established and the vertical vibration transmission and energy dissipation characteristics through the multiple transmitting interfaces under the impulse force due to gear fault are studied. The elastic deformations at the interfaces between gear and shaft, inner race and outer race, outer race and housing are formulated by the corresponding contact stiffness. The housing compliance is also included. A half-sine impulse force with two characteristic parameters as amplitude and time duration, which are associated with the defect type and size, is employed to represent the effect of gear fault on the system dynamics. The acceleration responses for different transmitting components as gear, inner race, outer race and housing are calculated for different impulse time duration, different impulse force amplitudes and shaft rotating speeds. The vibration transmission and energy dissipation through the multiple interfaces are characterized by the defined vibration transmission ratio and energy dissipation ratio. Obvious attenuation in acceleration magnitude is observed between the transmitting components from gear to housing. The maximum attenuation occurs at the transmission from inner race to outer race, while the minimum is between the outer race and the housing. The time duration of the impulse force determines the resonance and also the vibration transmission characteristics of the system. The energy dissipation increases nonlinearly with the amplitude of the applied impulse force. Results also suggest that the interface between inner race and outer race, and the interface between gear and shaft dissipated about 60% and 40% of the total energy, are the main sources of energy dissipation in the system. However, the shaft rotating speed has limited effect on the vertical impulse vibration amplitude, vibration transmission and energy dissipation. Experimental validation is performed, which supports the characteristics obtained from numerical results.},

Our approach is to consider fully-coupled models in which the governing equations for the lubricating film, the elastic deformation and the force balance are each discretized and solved as a single monolithic nonlinear system of algebraic equations. The main contributions of this work are to propose, implement and analyse a novel, optimal, preconditioner for the Newton linearization of this algebraic system, and to assess the development of efficient finite element meshes through both manual tuning and the use of adaptive mesh refinement based upon a posteriori error estimation and control. Throughout this work, we employ first order finite element discretizations for both the Reynolds equation (for the lubricant) and for the linear elasticity model on a finite domain. The resulting nonlinear algebraic equations are then solved using a quasi-Newton algorithm. For each linear solve a Krylov subspace method is used and a new blockwise preconditioner is presented which is designed to exploit the specific structure that is present in this class of problem. This preconditioner combines the use of multigrid preconditioning for the elasticity block and a separate, efficient, approximation to precondition the Reynolds block.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><SPAN style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The solver developed in this work can be distinguished into two variants based upon the use of algebraic and geometric multigrid preconditioning of the elasticity block. Numerical results are presented both for line and point contact problems to validate the implementations and to allow a comparison of the performance and efficiency of the proposed solution strategies compared to the use of a state-of-the-art sparse direct solver at each Newton step. These results demonstrate that the preconditioned iterative approach is both computationally and memory superior to the sparse direct solver. Most importantly, both the computational and memory costs are seen to grow linearly with the number of unknowns. A locally adaptive solution scheme is also developed for fully-coupled EHL point contact problems. This automates the refinement process to the regions of the domain which exhibit large error in their solutions. Numerical results are presented demonstrating the performance and effectiveness of the procedure.},

In this paper, the authors’ intention is to discuss this issue with a perspective as objective as possible and performing a study on factual and known scientific knowledge, applying tribology modelling and methods. The effects of kinematic sliding of Hertzian contacts are studied from three different standpoints: (1) by analysing the combination of sliding speed and contact pressure giving rise to seizure, that is high instantaneous contact temperatures leading to film collapse, (2) by assessing the possible effects of sliding to surface traction and fatigue, (3) by discussing other possible effects of sliding in heavily loaded lubricated contacts as the concurrent damage mechanism caused by wear and rolling contact fatigue. Throughout the paper, different numerical models are presented and discussed alongside with some experimental data. This approach provides a comprehensive assessment of the various phenomena related to the kinematic sliding of rolling bearings. The different mechanisms involved and the interaction of sliding with the elastohydrodynamic lubricant film, frictional stress, wear and fatigue are discussed, and their significance to the performance of the bearing is qualified.},

This new approach presents a unified framework for constitutive modeling of complex materials in finite element analysis using evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR). EPR is a data-driven method based on evolutionary computing, aimed to search for polynomial structures representing a system. A procedure is presented for construction of EPR- based constitutive model (EPRCM) and its integration in finite element procedure. The main advantage of EPRCM over conventional and neural network-based constitutive models is that it provides the optimum structure for the material constitutive model representation as well as its parameters, directly from raw experimental (or field) data. It can learn nonlinear and complex material behavior without any prior assumption on the constitutive relationship. The proposed approach provides a transparent relationship for the constitutive material model that can readily be incorporated in a finite element model. A procedure is presented for efficient training of EPR, computing the stiffness matrix using the trained EPR model and incorporation of the EPRCM in a commercial finite element code, ABAQUS. The application of the developed EPR-based finite element method is illustrated through two examples and advantages of the proposed method over conventional and neural network-based FE methods are highlighted.},

   abstract = {Structural finite-element analysis (FEA) has been widely used to study the biomechanics of human tissues and organs, as well as tissue–medical device interactions, and treatment strategies. However, patient-specific FEA models usually require complex procedures to set up and long computing times to obtain final simulation results, preventing prompt feedback to clinicians in time-sensitive clinical applications. In this study, by using machine learning techniques, we developed a deep learning (DL) model to directly estimate the stress distributions of the aorta. The DL model was designed and trained to take the input of FEA and directly output the aortic wall stress distributions, bypassing the FEA calculation process. The trained DL model is capable of predicting the stress distributions with average errors of 0.492% and 0.891% in the Von Mises stress distribution and peak Von Mises stress, respectively. This study marks, to our knowledge, the first study that demonstrates the feasibility and great potential of using the DL technique as a fast and accurate surrogate of FEA for stress analysis.},

Wear debris particles collected from the bearings by ferrography were studied with scanning electron microscopy using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The results of ferrography were correlated with the metallographic observations made on the worn bearings. It was found that for lightly loaded high speed roller bearings rolling contact fatigue including surface pitting is not a significant wear or failure mechanism. However, misalignment due to shaft deflection above a critical point cannot be tolerated. Wear of high speed engine bearings can successfully be monitored by ferrography but, as the wear condition accelerates, frequent oil sample collections are beneficial. © 1987.},

   abstract = {The main failure mode of cylindrical roller bearings (CROBs) is localized surface defects (LSDs) such as spalls and pits on the surface of its races or rollers. However, it is difficult to describe the time-varying deflection excitation (TVDE) generated by a LSD and time-varying contact stiffness excitation due to the changes in contact conditions between the roller and defect by using the previous defect models. In this paper, a new dynamic analysis method is proposed to formulate a LSD more accurately for a CROB dynamic modeling. A two-degree of freedom dynamic model for a CROB with a LSD on its races is proposed, which considers both the TVDE and time-varying contact stiffness coefficient produced by the defect. The load-deflection relationship between the roller and race is considered as non-Hertzian one, which can be used to determine the load-deflection relationship between the logarithmic-profile roller and races of the CROB. The numerical results are compared with the available results from the previous defect models in the literature. Effects of the radial load, defect sizes and types on the contact deformation and contact force between the roller and race are investigated, as well as the vibrations characteristics of the CROB. The results show that the proposed method can describe more accurately a real excitation produced by a LSD located at anywhere in the contact zone between the roller and race, which cannot be captured by the previous model in the literature.},

The presented model is a further step to develop an accurate and efficient characterization of the ball bearing's rotor dynamic parameters such as stiffness and deflections as well as vibrational excitations induced by the discrete rolling elements. To make it applicable to high speed turbomachinery, the model considers centrifugal forces, gyroscopic effects and ball spinning. The consideration of an elastic outer ring makes the bearing model suitable for integrated lightweight bearing constructions used in modern aircraft turbines. In order to include transient rotordynamic behavior, the model is built as a full dynamic multibody simulation with time integration. To investigate the influence of the elasticity of the outer ring, a comparison with a rigid formulation for several rotational speeds and loads is presented.},

This model is developed with the assumptions that outer raceway is fixed in space and other elements have three degrees of freedom (DOF): two translations and one rotation. Centrifugal forces, gravity forces and slipping of the rollers are taken into account. The couplings of the Hertzian line contact deformation theory and the slice method are used to calculate all the contact forces. Local deflections due to defects are introduced into the constructed model by the time-varying deflection excitation. The equations of motion are established by the Newton-Euler method and solved by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta integration method with variable steps. Both time and frequency domains are used to analyse dynamic responses of the defective bearing. Some new components of the characteristic defect frequency can be seen from the results. The effects of time-varying surface models, different defect types and defect sizes on dynamic responses of the defective bearing are studied. An experiment is carried out to validate the proposed model. Comparison of the frequency spectrum in simulation results with that in the experiment shows reasonable qualitative agreement.

The influence of the raceway thickness of the outer race on the component stress, contact forces, and vibrations of the roller bearing is studied, which has not yet been investigated in previous work. All components of the roller bearing are modeled as elastic bodies. The waveforms of the contact force and the acceleration of the bearings considering different thickness percentages are compared, as well as the acceleration statistics and component stresses. The simulation results show that the raceway thickness of the outer race has a great influence on the stress, the contact force, and the vibrations of the bearing. It seems that an outer race with a suitable raceway thickness can be useful for decreasing the contact force and vibrations of the roller bearings. The presented results can give some guidance for the roller bearing design and geometry optimization.},

This work proposes a novel method to reduce the effect of this drift to accurately measure human gait using wearable sensors. Firstly, an infinite impulse response (IIR) digital 4th order Butterworth filter was implemented to remove the noise from the raw gyro sensor data. Secondly, the mode value of the static state gyro sensor data was subtracted from the measured data to remove offset values. Thirdly, a robust double derivative and integration method was introduced to remove any remaining drift error from the data. Lastly, sensor attachment errors were minimized by establishing the gravitational acceleration vector from the acceleration data at standing upright and sitting posture. These improvements proposed allowed for removing the drift effect, and showed an average of 2.1°, 33.3°, 15.6° difference for the hip knee and ankle joint flexion/extension angle, when compared to without implementation. Kinematic and spatio-temporal gait parameters were also calculated from the heel-contact and toe-off timing of the foot.

   abstract = {This paper presents the results of an analysis of the lubricated roller-to-raceway contact dynamics under transient conditions. This is caused by the load distribution in a bearing as a roller traverses from an unloaded to a highly loaded region. The roller is subjected to combined rolling and tilting motions due to the transient nature of the applied contact load. Correspondingly, the lubricated contact undergoes combined steady-state entraining motion and cyclic squeeze film action, with a steady total bearing load assumed. The results show that the roller tilts from side to side as it moves from the unloaded into the loaded region, and in the presence of a diminishing gap suffers higher pressures. In the meantime the regime of lubrication alters from iso-viscous rigid to full elastohydrodynamic. A major finding of this paper is regarding the emergence of a squeeze cave region in the contact, prevailing under a regime of lubrication different from the overall contact conditions, as indicated by the regimes of lubrication charts. The significance of this finding is that under isothermal conditions the kinematics of the contact and regional lubricant behaviour can lead to the formation of a dimple, even without the recently proposed thermal wedging effect.},

   abstract = {A theoretical coupling loss factor for the vibration transmission through a rolling element bearing problem has been developed for the statistical energy analysis (SEA) technique. This scheme includes the bearing stiffness matrix developed earlier in the companion paper Part I. The same problem has been analyzed previously by using deterministic vibration models in Parts II and III. In this paper, a new analytical procedure is developed to obtain the coupling loss factor between the shaft and casing which is based on the solution of the boundary value problem at the plate-bearing interface. Several example cases are chosen to demonstrate the salient features of this method: I, a plate-cantilevered beam problem; II, case I with circular shaft-bearing replacing the cantilevered beam; III, a shaft-bearing-plate system. Example case I is a revised version of the problem analyzed earlier by Lyon and Eichler (reference [6] of this paper). Our proposed calculation indicates an improvement in the coupling loss factor prediction for a thin plate-cantilevered beam system. Example case II deals with the development of a theoretical scheme to compute coupling loss factor for a bearing system. This development is extended further to predict mean-square vibratory response of a rectangular plate for example case III. Results of the statistical energy analysis compare well with the predictions yielded by deterministic model of Part II. Predictions for example cases I and III are found to be in good agreement with measurements. © 1992.},

   abstract = {Surface waviness is one important source of vibrations in a roller bearing. When the surface waviness occurs on the surface of the inner or outer race of a roller bearing, a time-varying deflection excitation and a time-varying contact stiffness excitation can be generated due to the changes in the curvature radii of the race with surface waviness at the contact position between the roller and the race of the roller bearing. In this paper, a new dynamic model (TDCE model) considering both the time-varying deflection excitation, the time-varying contact stiffness excitation, and the lubricating oil film is proposed to investigate vibration responses of a lubricated roller bearing with a uniform and a nonuniform surface waviness on its races, which cannot be accurately modelled by the previous time-varying deflection excitation (PTDE) model in the literature. Effects of the number, the maximum amplitude, and the nonuniform distribution of the surface waviness on the contact stiffness between one roller and the race with surface waviness are investigated, as well as the vibration responses of a lubricated roller bearing. Numerical results from the proposed model are compared with those from the PTDE model in the literature, which shows that the proposed TDCE model can provide more accurate impulses generated by the surface waviness on the races of the roller bearing. Moreover, the results show that the proposed method can provide a new vibration modelling method for a lubricated roller bearing with the uniform and nonuniform surface waviness on its races.},

   abstract = {Efficiency and durability are key areas of research and development in modern racing drivetrains. Stringent regulations necessitate the need for components capable of operating under highly loaded conditions whilst being efficient and reliable. Downsizing, increasing the power-to-weight ratio and modification of gear teeth geometry to reduce friction are some of the actions undertaken to achieve these objectives. These approaches can however result in reduced structural integrity and component durability. Achieving a balance between system reliability and optimal efficiency requires detailed integrated multidisciplinary analyses, with the consideration of system dynamics, contact mechanics/tribology and stress analysis/structural integrity. This paper presents an analytical model to predict quasi-static contact power losses in lubricated spur gear sets operating under the Elastohydrodynamic regime of lubrication. Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA) is used to predict variations in contact loads, local surface curvature and rolling and sliding velocities. This is combined with an extrapolated oil film thickness formula available in literature, to predict instantaneous lubricant film thickness and sub-surface stresses. Subsequently, viscous and boundary friction are estimated, enabling calculation of power losses. The presented methodology has been used to investigate the effects of parabolic tip relief on power loss and induced sub-surface stresses. The results of this investigation are also presented.},

   abstract = {This paper presents an investigation into Elastohydrodynamic (EHL) modeling of differential hypoid gears that can be used in coupling with Newtonian (or multibody) dynamics to study Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) phenomena, such as axle whine. The latter is a noise of a tonal nature, emitted from differential axles, characterised by the gear meshing frequency and its multiples. It appears at a variety of operating conditions; during drive and coasting, high and low torque loading. Key design targets for differential hypoid gears are improved efficiency and reduced vibration, which depend critically on the formation of an EHL lubricant film. The stiffness and damping of the oil film and friction generated in the contact can have important effects and cannot be neglected when examining the NVH behaviour of hypoid gears. The operating conditions in hypoid gears are usually characterized by high load, relatively low speeds, angled flow and elliptical contact footprint of high aspect ratio. Some extrapolated/empirical equations to estimate friction and film thickness have been reported for moderate loads. However, their use in hypoid gears is questionable. Additionally, the majority of reported numerical models for film thickness and friction have not been applied under such operating conditions. In this paper a numerical model of EHL elliptical point contact has been presented to obtain the EHL film behaviour under the usual range of operating conditions of hypoid gears. Realistic engine torque-speed characteristics are used. For these conditions, the load share per teeth pair contact is in the region of 500-6000N. A suitable method of solution is applied to ease the convergence of the numerical method, namely the distributed line low relaxation effective influence Newton-Raphson method. As the result of the angled direction of the entraining flow in the contact of hypoid gear teeth pairs, this method has been found to be suitable, thus adopted. The geometric and kinematic input data for EHL calculations are calculated using Tooth Contact Analysis (TCA). Copyright © 2012 SAE International.},

Firstly, the circumferential extents of bearing raceway defects and the influence of axial preload on the number of loaded balls, load distribution and stiffness of static bearing are investigated. Secondly, the influence of varying compliance on the time-varying stiffness of defect-free ball bearing at different rotational speeds is explored. And finally, the time-varying stiffness of bearing with coupling of local defects and varying compliance is examined. Results show that the load distribution and the time-varying stiffness in the coupling state are not the simple superposition of the two states acting separately; they will interact and influence each other, and jointly change the supporting characteristics of bearing.

Three half-spaces with mirrored loads to be solved are overlapped to cancel out the stresses at expected surfaces, and three matrices can be obtained and reused for the same finite-length space. The isothermal Reynolds equation is solved to obtain the pressure distribution and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to speed up the elastic deformation and stress related calculation.

An initial mutual approach between interacting surfaces, which deviates from the steady-state balanced position, is assumed under the free contact-vibration to predict the response of the mutual approach. An inertia term, which represents the acceleration of the gap motion, is added to the classical force balance equation to form the equation of motion of the mutual approach. Response of the mutual approach is solved based upon the solving of the contact-dynamic model. The oil stiffness is calculated according to the natural frequency of the response under damped and non-damped conditions, the latter of which represents dry contact conditions. The oil film damping is calculated in terms of the principle of the energy conservation which utilizes the whole history of response compared with the log decrement method. Effect of the normal load, the rolling speed and the amplitude of the regular sinusoidal surface waviness on the oil film stiffness, the contact stiffness and the oil film damping are studied. The study provides an insight on the oil film dynamic characteristics of lubricated contact-vibration problems which appear in gears, bearings, etc. The results show that the oil film damping factor decreases with the increasing normal load as well as the increasing rolling speed. The oil film stiffness increases with the normal load and decreases with the rolling speed. Also, compared to the contact stiffness, the oil film stiffness makes less contribution to the total stiffness. The surface waviness amplitude has little effect on the oil film stiffness and the oil film damping.},

   abstract = {The elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime occurs in systems where large elastic deformations, the hydrodynamic action of a converging wedge and eventually large variation of viscosity of the fluid combine to determine the formation of a continuous fluid film that separates the solid surfaces. Experimental and theoretical works, over the past few decades, have elucidated the role of various working and material parameters on the lubricant film thickness which plays a crucial role in protecting the solid surfaces from direct contact and ultimately from failure. These mechanisms are well understood for steady-state conditions; however, elastohydrodynamic contacts most often experience transient conditions, including variation of geometry, velocity of surfaces or load. In this case, the mechanisms of film formation are more complex involving film squeeze in addition to the mechanisms mentioned above. Experimental and theoretical modelling of transient phenomena in elastohydrodynamic lubrication include sudden variation of entrainment speed or load and changing geometry. No systematic experimental study on the effect of harmonic load vibration upon the elastohydrodynamic films has been published before. In order to cover this gap, this paper presents the results of an experimental study and of a simple theoretical approach on the behaviour of the elastohydrodynamic film thickness under harmonic variation of load.},

In the current article a summary of these developments is given. Smooth surface EHL has become well established. Numericalmethods, analytical solutions, and experimental techniques have become mature. Focus areas of research today are thermal EHL, starved EHL, friction (non-Newtonian lubricants), roughness, and grease. The scope of EHL is so wide that the authors needed select the topics of focus in this article. Therefore, in addition to the general overview of the areas of friction, analytical methods, starved EHL, and grease EHL are highlighted in this article.

Only a relatively small portion of the EHL literature has, however, dealt with the lubricating performance of finite line contacts under non-steady conditions, commonly found in many practical applications. The purpose of this work has thus been to further understand the behaviour of finite line EHL contacts under transient conditions by studying a finite length roller subjected to a time varying load using a full-system finite element approach. The transient load was shown to initiate oscillations in the system, governed by waves of lubricant moving through the contact, affecting both pressure and film thickness throughout the contact.},

This paper presents nonlinear bearing forces of a roller bearing under four-dimensional loads and establishes 4-DOF dynamics equations of a rotor roller bearing system. The methods of Newmark-β and of Newton-Laphson are used to solve the nonlinear equations. The dynamics behaviors of a rigid rotor system are studied through the bifurcation, the Poincar è maps, the spectrum diagrams and the axis orbit of responses of the system. The results show that the system is liable to undergo instability caused by the quasi-periodic bifurcation, the periodic-doubling bifurcation and chaos routes as the rotational speed increases. Clearances, outer race waviness, inner race waviness, roller waviness, damping, radial forces and unbalanced forces-all these bring a significant influence to bear on the system stability. As the clearance increases, the dynamics behaviors become complicated with the number and the scale of instable regions becoming larger. The vibration frequencies induced by the roller bearing waviness and the orders of the waviness might cause severe vibrations. The system is able to eliminate non-periodic vibration by reasonable choice and optimization of the parameters.},

The amplitudes of these vibrations are shown to be considerably reduced if the preload and number of balls are correctly selected. All results show that the vibration characteristics of the shaft and its bearings change when the bearings operate in different regions of their nonlinear load-deflection characteristics.

Several different methods exist to simulate these pressure distributions and in time domain bearing simulations, where many contacts need evaluation, the simple and time efficient methods are more popular, yielding erroneous life estimates. This paper presents a new six degree of freedom frictionless quasi-static time domain cylindrical roller bearing model that uses high precision elastic half-space theory to simulate the contact pressures. The potentially higher computational demand using the advanced contact calculations is addressed by preprocessing a series of contacts at different centerline approaches and roller tilt angles, which are used for interpolating contact results during time domain simulations. It is demonstrated that this new model allows for simulation of bearing misalignments, roller centrifugal forces, and flange contact induced roller tilt moments, and that the effect of these conditions is directly evaluated in a detailed fatigue life analysis. Finally, the stiffness of the bearing model is validated against existing experimental data with good correlation. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

Therefore, an increased understanding of lubricated contacts becomes important where oil viscosity-pressure and compressibility-pressure behavior have been shown to influence the film thickness and pressure distribution in elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) contacts, further influencing the durability. In this work, a finite line EHL contact is analyzed with focus on the oil compressibility-pressure and viscosity-pressure response, comparing two oils with relatively different behavior and its influence on subsurface stress concentrations in the contacting bodies. Results indicate that increased pressure gradients and pressure spikes, and therefore increased localized stress concentrations, can be expected for stiffer, less compressible oils, which under transient loading conditions not only affect the outlet but also the edges of the roller.},

The calculations yield the oil film thickness, the pressure distribution and the shape of the deformed system. Solutions are given showing the effect of load and speed; the influence of the pressure coefficient of viscosity of the oil, and of the elasticity of the rollers is also shown. The main feature of the results is the prediction of peaks of pressure on the outlet side of the system, the height of the peaks depending greatly upon the foregoing variables. The theory is compared with the available experimental evidence and though it is a clear improvement upon earlier theories, significant differences between theory and experiment yet remain. The origin of these differences is discussed and it is concluded that there is greater need at the present time for fuller experimental evidence than for further elaborations in the theory.},

Unlike spur and helical involute gears, there is a dearth of numerical analysis in the case of hypoid gear pairs. In particular, it is important to take into account the side leakage of the lubricant from the contact as the result of the lubricant entrainment at an angle to the elliptical contact footprint. In the automobile differential hypoid gears, high loads result in non-Newtonian behaviour of the lubricant, which may exceed its limiting shear stress, a fact which has not been taken into account in the open literature. This results in conditions which deviate from observed experimental tractive behaviour. The paper takes into account these salient practical features of hypoid gear pair analysis under high load. It highlights a non-Newtonian shear model, which limits the lubricant shear behaviour. Prediction of friction and transmission efficiency is in line with those reported in the literature. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

For a lubricant of known rheological properties, it is shown how a ‘map’ can be constructed in which different areas of the map correspond to different regimes of behaviour. The coordinates chosen for the map are non-dimensional pressure and a parameter which is closely related to the film thickness. Given the load, speed and temperature, the operating conditions can be located as a point in the map. Maps have been constructed for three fluids: a mineral oil, polyphenyl ether 5P4E and a traction fluid. In general the maps display four regimes: (a) Newtonian, (b) Eyring, (c) viscoelastic and (d) elastic-plastic. Appropriate constitutive equations are proposed for each regime from which the traction forces can be predicted.

   abstract = {Environmental concerns as well as regulatory requirements are driving the development of alternative vehicle propulsion systems. Electric vehicles (EV's) are attractive because they emit no pollutants. In this paper, we examine the sound quality characteristics of wind and powertrain noise in electric vehicles. Sound quality is an important attribute of EV's, because the expectation is that they will be very quiet due to the absence of an internal combustion engine. As we show in this paper, the absence of engine noise is both a blessing and a curse for sound quality. For wind noise, the results show that electric and gasoline vehicles have equivalent wind noise loudness levels at all speeds. However, at lower speeds (50-60 mph), the EV is judged to have more wind noise even though the level was the same as the gasoline vehicle! The difference is that, in the EV, there is no engine noise to mask the wind noise. While EV's have no engine noise they do have powertrain noise, primarily from the planetary gears used in the transmission. During accelerations and decelerations, there is significant gear whine. If reduced to tolerable levels, this gear whine can provide a not unpleasant audible feedback as the throttle is manipulated. At idle, EV's make virtually no noise. Thus, any accessory noise (A/C, power steering pump, fan) will be quite prominent and may be annoying due to it's strong tonal quality. While electric vehicles will be relatively quiet, they still present significant sound quality challenges. Copyright © 1999 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.},

   abstract = {The classical ElastoHydroDynamic (EHD) theory assumes a Newtonian lubricant and an isothermal operating regime. In reality, lubricating oils do not behave as perfect Newtonian fluids. Moreover, in most operating conditions of an engineering system, especially at high speeds, thermal effects are important and temperature can no longer be considered as constant throughout the system. This is one reason why there has always been a gap between numerical results and experimental data. This paper aims to show that this gap can be reduced by taking into consideration the heat generation that takes place in the contact and using appropriate rheological models. For this, a unique thermal ElastoHydrodynamic lubrication model is developed for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian lubricants. Pressure, film thickness and traction results are then compared to their equivalent isothermal results and experimental data. The agreement between thermal calculations and experiments reveals the necessity of considering thermal effects in EHD models. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.},

In the numerical example, it is shown that for a given speed the variations of the contact loads on the inner and outer raceways and the flange increase with misalignment. On the other hand, for a specified misalignment, the contact loads on the raceways are found to decrease and the contact loads and sliding velocities at the flange contacts increase when the bearing speed increases. These results reveal the importance of obtaining optimum designs for the flange and the roller sphere end in high speed applications. The analysis can be useful in making design comparisons.},

   abstract = {<p>Increased use of high speed machining creates the need to predict spindle-bearing performance at high speeds. Previous spindle-bearing models simplify either spindle or bearing dynamics to the extent of prohibiting a detailed analysis of a spindle with high speed motion. At high speeds, centrifugal loading in the bearing causes stiffness softening, creating a change in natural frequency. Therefore, spindle modeling requires a comprehensive representation of the dynamics of shafts with complex geometry rotating at high speeds and supported by non-linear bearings. This paper presents a coupled system of spindle and bearing dynamic models with numerical solution. Spindle dynamics are modeled using the influence coefficient method of discrete lumped masses, based on Timoshenko beam theory. Both linear and rotational bearing stiffness are included in the spindle model through solution of the angular-contact bearing model. The parameters of cutting loads, tool mass, and rotational speed are analyzed, and all are shown to affect the natural frequency. The computer model is both rapid and robust, and shows excellent agreement with experimental analysis.</p>},

   abstract = {The rattle phenomenon in vehicular transmissions and its impact on the automotive industry have been widely reported in the literature. A variety of palliative measures have been suggested for attenuation of rattle such as use of backlash eliminators, clutch dampers or dual-mass flywheels. These palliative measures incur further costs and can have untoward implications in powertrain noise and vibration problems. A fundamental investigation of the dynamics of impacting gears is undoubtedly the way forward for a root cause solution. This paper introduces a new approach for understanding the interactions between the transmission gears during engine idle conditions by taking into account the effect of lubrication. Gear impacting surfaces are treated as lubricated conjunctions rather than the usually reported dry impacting solids. Depending on load and speed of entraining motion of the lubricant into the contact domains, the regime of lubrication alters. In this paper, the influence of lubricant in torsional vibration of lightly loaded idling gears is examined which promotes iso-viscous hydrodynamic conditions. It is shown that the lubricant film under these conditions behaves as a time-varying nonlinear spring-damper element. Spectral analysis of the system response is compared to the findings of the linearised system. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The models consider elastohydrodynamic lubrication and contact elasticity between the roller and raceway, roller centrifugal forces, hydrodynamic lubrication at the cage pocket, and frictional forces. Using these models, the predicted cage and roller speeds and the extent of slip are compared to measurements acquired on cylindrical roller bearings in a commercial gearbox in steady-state and transient operating conditions of a wind turbine. In steady-state conditions at low wind speeds and low lubricant temperatures, cage and roller slip up to 60% occur in the loaded zone of the bearing. In the unloaded zone, up to 80% roller slip occurs. Cage and roller slip then decrease as the lubricant temperature and wind speed increases. In general, the analytical model results match experimental measurements within 10% for lubricant temperatures above 40°C and wind speeds over 10 meters per second. The analytical model is further evaluated during a transient start-up event and highly dynamic emergency stop event and also used to examine changes in the bearing design or lubricant properties. Roller and cage slip in cylindrical bearings is a combined effect of the bearing design, applied load, shaft speed, and lubricant properties and temperature, and can be quickly evaluated with the combined analytical models.},

   abstract = {Growing concerns over energy and environmental sustainability have lately sparked worldwide interest in more efficient and cleaner transportation systems and industrial activities. Friction roughly consumes one-fifth of all energy used worldwide. One-third of all energy used in transportation goes to overcome friction. At the same time, the fruits of decades of dedicated research on all-electric vehicles powered by advanced batteries are paving the way toward a much cleaner and sustainable transportation future. In this article, we provide a short overview of what are the energy efficiency and environmental impacts of current transportation, industrial, and residential systems and how much of that efficiency is adversely affected by friction and wear losses in moving mechanical parts and components. We also touch upon recent advances in new materials, lubricants, and design changes that could reduce energy losses by 18–40%, mainly resulting from friction and wear. The savings would be up to 8.7% of the total global energy use and 1.4% of the gross national products (GNP). Finally, we calculate the energy consumption and friction losses in battery-powered electric passenger cars and show the benefit of electric cars where the total energy use is in average 3.4 times lower compared to combustion engine powered cars. The CO2 emissions are 4.5 times higher for a combustion engine car compared to an electric car when the electricity comes from renewable energy sources. Moving from fossil to renewable energy sources may cut down the energy losses due to friction in energy production by more than 60%.},

This paper presents a two degrees of freedom (2-DOF) dimensionless mathematical model for ball bearings describing a procedure, which helps to scale the problem and reveal the relationships between dimensionless terms and their influence on the system’s response. The derived mathematical model considers nonlinear features as stiffness, damping, and radial internal clearance referring to the Hertzian contact theory. Further, important features are also taken into account including an external load, the eccentricity of the shaft-bearing system, and shape errors on the raceway investigating variable dynamics of the ball bearing. Analysis of obtained responses with Fast Fourier Transform, phase plots, orbit plots, and recurrences provide a rich source of information about the dynamics of the system and it helped to find the transition between the periodic and chaotic response and how it affects the topology of RPs and recurrence quantificators.},

   abstract = {© 2021 Elsevier Ltd Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) polymer is used extensively in industry as a solid lubricant because of its lack of reactivity with most industrial materials. However, PTFE has a low abrasive resistance, limiting its application. In this study, the mechanical and tribological characteristics of PTFE-based composites with the addition of clay nano-sheets (CNSs) were investigated. Clay nano-sheet-PTFE composites (CNSTCs) containing 1, 3, and 5 wt. % of CNSs were prepared by employing a compression moulding method. To investigate the tribological characteristics and wear mechanism of CNSTCs, a pin-on-ring test, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and optical microscopy (OM) were employed. The results indicate that adding CNSs decreased the friction coefficient substantially. Additionally, the wear rates decreased from 1.09 × 10−3 mm3/(Nm) in the pure PTFE sample to 0.32 × 10-5 mm3/(Nm) for the 5 wt. % CNSs filled composite. This shows that the wear rate of the PTFE-based composite is reduced by up to 340 times with the addition of 5 wt. % CNSs. SEM and OM observations revealed that CNSs could inhibit the growth of microcracks in CNSTCs and change the wear mechanism from adhesive to abrasive. Furthermore, adding CNSs resulted in a more uniform and thinner transition film formation, with reduced secondary wear and friction. The effects of the size, percentage, and type of embedded fillers were compared with previous studies. The analysis revealed that in addition to competitive cost and high availability, CNSs have superior characteristics and can be employed to enhance the tribological properties of PTFE nanocomposites.},

Various formulations are currently proposed to deal with multiphysics modeling, e.g., graph theories, equational approaches, co-simulation techniques. Recent works have pointed out their relative advantages and drawbacks, depending on the application to deal with: model size, model complexity, degree of coupling, frequency range, etc. This paper is the result of a close collaboration between three laboratories, and aims at showing that for "non-academic" mechatronic applications (i.e., issuing from real industrial issues), multibody dynamics formulations can be generalized to mechatronic systems, for the model generation as well as for the numerical analysis phases. Model portability being also an important aspect of the work, they must be easily interfaced with control design and optimization programs. A global "demonstrator", based on an industrial case, is discussed: multiphysics modeling and mathematical optimization are carried out to illustrate the consistency and the efficiency of the proposed approaches. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

   abstract = {The development of machinery often requires system-level analysis, in which non-mechanical subsystems, such as hydraulics, need to be considered. Co-simulation allows analysts to divide a problem into subsystems and use tailored software solutions to deal individually with their respective dynamics. On the other hand, these subsystems must be coupled at particular instants in time, called communication points, through the exchange of coupling variables. Between communication points, each subsystem solver carries out the integration of its states without interacting with its environment. This may cause the integration to become unstable, especially when non-iterative co-simulation is used. The co-simulation configuration, i.e., the parameters and simulation options selected by the analyst, such as the way to handle the coupling variables or the choice of subsystem solvers, is often a critical factor regarding co-simulation stability. In practice it is difficult to anticipate which selection is the most appropriate for a particular problem, especially if some inputs come from external sources, such as human operators, and cannot be determined beforehand. We put forward a methodology to automatically determine a stable and computationally efficient configuration for Jacobi-scheme co-simulation. The method uses energy residuals to gain insight into co-simulation stability. The relation between energy residual and communication step-size is exploited to monitor co-simulation accuracy during a series of tests in which the external inputs are replaced with predetermined input functions. The method was tested with hydraulically actuated mechanical examples. Results indicate that the proposed method can be used to find stable and accurate configurations for co-simulation applications.},

   abstract = {Currently, multibody dynamics simulations are moving away from issues exclusive to dynamics to more multiphysical problems. Most mechanical systems contain contact pairs that influence the dynamics of the entire mechanism, such as friction loss, wear, vibration and noise. In addition, deformation often affects the interaction between the contact bodies. If that is the case, this effect must be considered. However, a major disadvantage arises in that it leads to an increase in the number of degrees of freedom and the computational time. Often, the general-purpose multibody dynamics software does not take into account advanced phenomena, such as a lubricated contact pair. This paper can serve as a guide to implementing the elastohydrodynamic lubrication of rough surfaces into general-purpose multibody dynamics software (in this case MSC Adams), which remains challenging. In this paper, the deformation shape reconstruction of the reduced flexible bodies is described, as well as a solution to the increase in the computational speed issues thereby caused. To alleviate this burden, advanced sensitivity analysis techniques are used. In this paper, parallel computing has been employed. The proposed method leads to reasonable computational times for the multibody dynamics simulations, including elastohydrodynamic lubrication. The proposed method is applied to the multibody dynamics simulation of the piston–liner interaction of an internal combustion engine.},

This numerical simulation method provided a more realistic turbocharger calculation model and a more reliable theoretical support for studying the dynamic vibration characteristics of the floating ring bearing turbocharger system. In order to fully consider the dynamic characteristics of each component, the behavior of the floating ring bearing was described by generalized incompressible Reynolds equation in thermo-elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication model. The flexible body substructure models were established by the modal synthesis method. Based on this model, the direct mathematical model of the relationship between the eccentricity of the rotor and the oil film clearance on the turbocharger’s surface vibration was established. The influence of eccentricity and oil film thickness on the surface vibration of the turbocharger body was calculated by transient dynamics method. The results showed that the eccentricity of the rotor and the vibration of turbocharger housing were monotonic functions, but the interaction between the whirl of internal and external oil films made the mechanism of the influence of the oil film thickness on the turbocharger body’s vibration complicated. The research provided a new idea for the structural vibration and synchronous noise control of the supercharger.},

   abstract = {Squeeze-film dampers (SFD) are applied to provide damping at the outer ring of ball bearings used in jet engines. The main functions are to cap rotor oscillations and to reduce dynamic forces. A new test rig was designed to allow an orbital motion of the rotor shaft excited by two independently controllable electromagnetic shakers. In order to achieve this excitation, the two shakers are rigidly coupled together; due to this, a degree of freedom is missing in this mechanism. The precisely adjusted stiffness of the coupling elements acts as a solid joint to provide the missing DOF. The resulting shear forces acting on the opposite shaker are supported by a support structure, designed as part of the coupling elements. A multibody cosimulation and several other virtual studies are performed to verify and validate the dynamic behavior of the test rig. The SFD behavior cannot be implemented in the cosimulation by using a standard library damping element of the simulation tools because its behavior is nonlinear due to its design and functionality. It is implemented according to its valid theory, based on Reynolds equations for plain bearings. The calculation of the multibody physics takes place in MSC Adams, whereas the theory of the SFD is described and implemented as a mathematical model in MATLAB/Simu link.

Based on the finite-short bearing approach, the EHD lubrication condition for the cylindrical joints supporting the geared system is considered here. The lubrication forces developed at the cylindrical joints are obtained by solving the Reynolds’ equation via the finite difference method. For the evaluation of the normal contact forces of gear pair along the Line Of Action (LOA), the time-varying mesh stiffness, mesh damping and Static Transmission Error (STE) are utilized. The time-varying mesh stiffness is calculated by using the Chaari’s methodology. The forces of sliding friction along the Off-Line-Of-Action (OLOA) are computed by using the Coulomb friction models with a time-varying coefficient of friction under the EHD lubrication condition of gear teeth. Finally, two numerical examples of application are presented to demonstrate and validate the proposed methodology.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 \{Å\} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\{%\} with default Glide SP settings to 58\{%\} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\{%\} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\{%\} of peptides were docked successfully.

   abstract = {The computational simulation of multi-body dynamics (MBD) of moving structural components is one of the most challenging objectives in the design analysis work of automotive engineers. These simulations are a need to assess the vibro-acoustic quality of new products in the early development stage and can reduce development time and costs significantly. The concept of elastic MBD is based on dividing the non-linear mechanic system into subsystems with linear elastic behaviour (bodies) and non-linearities occurring only at the connections (joints) between these subsystems. Because of the non-linear characteristic of the system, the dynamic simulation has to be solved in time domain via numerical time integration. Both the necessary small time-step sizes and the iterative solution scheme within one time step imply large computational effort. Thus, the improvement of the efficiency and the stability are main targets for the software development. This article presents two variants of modelling linear elastic components via a multi-body model. The main difference between the two variants is in the strategy used for the separation of reference (global) motions and elastic deformations (small motions). The first variant applies a projection strategy, whereas the second variant considers reference conditions that are based on a minimum relative kinetic energy or on a minimal square average displacement approach. This article describes the mathematical modelling of the two variants, which based on the floating frame of reference formulation. On the basis of the theoretical formulation, a comparison of the two strategies from application as well as numerical and algorithmic point of view is presented. Consequently, the advantages and the disadvantages of the two approaches will be analysed. The results section compares the two presented methods, which were applied for the simulation of the dynamics of two crankshaft models. First, a crankshaft of a five-cylinder combustion engine is analysed. The second investigated example is a crankshaft of a one-cylinder engine with special consideration of different strategies for the applied reference conditions. Both the obtained calculation results and the computational performance in terms of CPU time are discussed. © IMechE 2006.},

Thus, an accurate rotordynamic analysis requires that bearing forces corresponding to the actual bearing deflection be utilized. For this work, bearing forces were calculated by COBRA-AHS, a recently developed rolling-element bearing analysis code. Bearing stiffness was found to be a strong function of bearing deflection, with higher deflection producing markedly higher stiffness. Curves fitted to the bearing data for a range of speeds and loads were supplied to a flexible rotor unbalance response analysis. The rotordynamic analysis showed that vibration response varied nonlinearly with the amount of rotor imbalance. Moreover, the increase in stiffness as critical speeds were approached caused a large increase in rotor and bearing vibration amplitude over part of the speed range compared to the case of constant-stiffness bearings. Regions of bistable operation were possible, in which the amplitude at a given speed was much larger during rotor acceleration than during deceleration. A moderate amount of damping will eliminate the bistable region, but this damping is not inherent in ball bearings.},

   abstract = {A semi-analytic approach is presented for the elastohydrodynamic lubrication problem of two cylinders in line contact. The model takes account of the effects of elastic deformation and piezo-viscosity in the transition region (the area of parameter space where the pressure spike emerges and develops). Following Poritsky, pressure and displacement are expressed as Chebyshev series and Fejér’s method is used to deal with the sharp crease in the film shape that is a feature of piezoviscous contacts. It is shown that the film thickness depends solely upon two non-dimensional parameters and can be accurately represented by an equation of the form: H = a 0 g 3 a 1 g 1 + a 2 g 3 a 3 , where the a i = 0, 1, 2, 3) are constant coefficients. Important features of this Chebyshev series method include accurate representations for the emerging pressure spike and the associated sharp crease in the film shape together with film thickness predictions which smoothly link those areas of parameter space on either side of the transition region.},

   abstract = {Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) is present in all lubricated components whose elements roll together, including gears, rolling bearing, cams and constant velocity joints. These are characterised by having very localised and thus very high pressure contact, of order 1 to 3 GPa, between the elements. Two important practical properties of EHL contacts are the lubricant film thickness and the friction, and lubricant and machine designers and users need to be able to predict both of these. In principle, they can be determined from full numerical solution of the elastohydrodynamic problem. However, this is quite difficult and timeconsuming and requires detailed knowledge of the rheology of the lubricant film at high pressure and shear rate. This paper is aimed at practising engineers and describes alternative approaches, i.e. how EHL can be applied to predict film thickness and friction in practical applications.},

On this basis, the composite stiffness model of the ball bearing is proposed, and the effects of different factors on dynamic characteristic parameters are investigated. The results show that different factors have different effects on the dynamic parameters. With the increase in preload, the contact stiffness and composite stiffness increase. Considering EHL, the radial contact stiffness and composite stiffness increase while the axial and angular contact stiffness and composite stiffness decrease. Considering the thermal effect and centrifugal effect, the radial contact stiffness and composite stiffness increase while the axial and angular contact stiffness and composite stiffness decrease.

A novel test rig is introduced, which allows testing different types and sizes of bearings in real-life conditions. The test rig dynamics are optimised such that the dynamic properties of the bearing are measured in a frequency range below the resonances of the flexible modes. Two properties of the bearing, both its stiffness and damping value in the direction of the static bearing load, are identified. The behaviour of the lubricant film between the rolling elements and raceways is measured based on the electrical resistance through the bearing. For this purpose, the bearing housing is electrically isolated from the surrounding structure. The electrical resistance, stiffness and damping of the test bearing are identified during a speed run-up. The influence of the bearing temperature is analysed as well. During a run-up at constant bearing temperature, the measurement of the electrical resistance describes the formation of the lubricant film. Due to the formation of the lubricant film, the bearing stiffness increases by 3.2% while the damping increases by 24%. During a warm-up of the bearing, the viscosity of the lubricant film decreases strongly. A resulting decrease in electrical resistance, stiffness and damping is measured. Finally, the electrical resistance, stiffness and damping are identified at different speeds, after the bearing has reached a stable temperature at each speed. A combined effect of both rotation and temperature is observed and discussed. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a numerical study of the effects of inlet supply starvation on film thickness in EHL point contacts. Generally this problem is treated using the position of the inlet meniscus as the governing parameter; however, it is difficult to measure this in real applications. Thus, in this paper an alternative approach is adopted whereby the amount of oil present on the surfaces is used to define the degree of starvation. It is this property which determines both meniscus position and film thickness reduction. The effect of subsequent overrollings on film thickness decay can also be evaluated. In the simplest case a constant lubricant inlet film thickness in the Y direction is assumed and the film thickness distribution is computed as a function of the oil available. This yields an equation predicting the film thickness reduction, with respect to the fully flooded value, from the amount of lubricant initially available on the surface, as a function of the number of overrollings n. However, the constant inlet film thickness does not give a realistic description of starvation for all conditions. Some experimental studies show that the combination of side flow and replenishment action can generate large differences in local oil supply and that the side reservoirs play an important role in this replenishment mechanism. Thus the contact centre can be fully starved whilst the contact sides remain well lubricated. In these cases, a complete analysis with a realistic inlet distribution has been carried out and the numerical results agree well with experimental findings.},

In this paper, film thickness measurements for various greases in a shielded deep groove ball bearing will be presented. The results were obtained using an in-house-made film thickness measurement rig based on the ‘electric capacitance method’. It will be shown that the film thickness may deviate from the theoretical elastohydrodynamic film thickness calculated from the base oil and that the film thickness is not constant in time. It will also be shown that the film thickness for longer times is not only determined by the classical properties such as oil viscosity and grease bleed but also by shear degradation of its microstructure.},

   abstract = {Improving knowledge on the film forming behavior of greases is essential to be able to develop efficient greases. This article examines how operating conditions (e.g., temperature, lubrication condition [fully flooded/starved]) and base oil viscosity influence the film forming properties of greases by comparing the behavior of two lithium-based greases and their respective base oils in rolling point contact. It is found that the onset and degree of starvation is controlled by speed (u) × viscosity (ν)/load (W) factor (uν/W) and temperature and that low uν/W values promote entrainment of thickener into contact. Thus, grease with low base oil viscosity shows significant thickener entrainment in the low speed region compared to the one with high base oil viscosity, which leads to the formation of thickener-rich viscous material during extended running with the low base oil viscosity grease. The results suggest that the shape of the film thickness versus speed curve is viscosity and uν/W range dependent. Furthermore, for the test conditions used in this study, grease-lubricated contacts appear to shift from the initial fully flooded condition to starved condition over a prolonged running of 2 h. The results from this study concur with those reported in the literature that fully flooded oil elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) theory or film thickness cannot be directly applied or taken as a guideline in grease-lubricated contacts.},

However, the service life of a group of identical bearings tested under identical conditions follows a typical pattern. Many theories that were established to describe this pattern are based on failure caused by fatigue due to cyclic loading. This loading causes high stresses and subsurface cracks. The cracks propagate and, once they reach the surface, cause bearing failure. These theories focus on the rolling elements and disregard the lubricant. This study is concerned with the failure mechanism caused by cavitation of the lubricant and presents its significant role in RCB failure. Both mechanisms act simultaneously and impose synergistic effects. It is therefore recommended to combine these theories into a unified concept.},

These results are then used to develop an expression for the central filn thickness in terms of the conventional dimensionless groups for line contacts. The resulting expression provides predictions of a feature of the geometry of elastohydrodynamic film shapes which is important in terms of lubricant flow, traction and the interpretation of capacitance measurements in experimental studies. The new central film thcikness formula is compared with the existing minimum film thickness formula and the two expressions provide predictions for two of the most important geometrical features of the film shapes encountered in elastohydrodynamic line contacts.

   abstract = {A complete evaluation of the tribological characteristics of a given material/mechanical system is a time-consuming operation since the friction and wear process is extremely systems-sensitive. As a result, experimental designs, i.e., Latin Square and Taguchi, have been implemented in an attempt to not only reduce the total number of experimental combinations needed to fully characterize a material/mechanical system, but also to acquire life data for a system without having to perform an actual life test. Unfortunately, these experimental designs still require a great deal of experimental testing and the output does not always produce meaningful information. In order to further reduce the amount of experimental testing required, this study employs a computer neural network model to investigate different material/mechanical systems. The work focuses on the modeling of the wear behavior, while showing the feasibility of using neural networks to predict life data. The model is capable of defining which input variables will influence the tribological behavior of the particular material/mechanical system being studied based on the specifications of the overall system. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

   abstract = {Purpose: In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are constructed and validated by using the bearing data generated numerically from a thermohydrodynamic (THD) lubrication model. In many tribological simulations, a surrogate model (meta-model) for obtaining a fast solution with sufficient accuracy is highly desired. Design/methodology/approach: The THD model is represented by two coupled partial differential equations, a simplified generalized Reynolds equation, considering the viscosity variation across the film thickness direction and a transient energy equation for the 3-D film temperature distribution. The ANNs tested are having a single- or dual-hidden-layer with two inputs and one output. The root-mean-square error and maximum/minimum absolute errors of validation points, when comparing with the THD solutions, were used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the ANNs. Findings: It is demonstrated that a properly constructed ANN surrogate model can predict the THD lubrication performance almost instantly with accuracy adequately retained. Originality/value: This study extends the use of ANNs to the applications other than the analyses dealing with experimental data. A similar procedure can be used to build a surrogate model for computationally intensive tribological models to have fast results. One of such applications is conducting extensive optimum design of tribological components or systems.

However, the prevailing approach has shifted to the application of deep learning concepts, with focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In general, this kind of technique requires large datasets containing a wide variety of conditions to work properly. This is an important limitation, given the many challenges involved in the construction of a suitable image database. In this context, this study investigates how the size and variety of the datasets impact the effectiveness of deep learning techniques applied to plant pathology. This investigation was based on an image database containing 12 plant species, each presenting very different characteristics in terms of number of samples, number of diseases and variety of conditions. Experimental results indicate that while the technical constraints linked to automatic plant disease classification have been largely overcome, the use of limited image datasets for training brings many undesirable consequences that still prevent the effective dissemination of this type of technology.},

In this paper, DNN performance is investigated with three categories of activation functions i.e. saturated, unsaturated and adaptive activation functions. The experimental results showed that the saturation problem of hyperbolic tangent activation function can be solved by adding two trainable parameters in its function. The trainable version of rectified linear unit i.e. parametric rectified linear unit (PReLU) obtained lowest misclassification rate among all types of activation function i.e. 1.6% misclassification rate on MNIST handwritten digit dataset. This is due to the adaptive activation functions allows the network to estimate a better solution by training the activation function parameters during the training process.

In this study, multiple-layer feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) modeling for tribological behavior of short alumina fiber reinforced zinc-aluminum composites has been established. The specific wear rate and coefficient of friction obtained from a series of the wear tests were used in the formation of training sets of ANN. Samples of composite material with 10, 15, 20 and 30 vol.% fiber contents were prepared by the pressure die-casting method. Wear tests with pin-on-disc arrangement had performed at a constant sliding speed of 1 m/s under four different loads (5, 10, 20 and 40 N). The results of experimental tests showed that wear behavior and friction coefficient of the composites were significantly affected by the fiber volume fraction. The specific wear rate decreased with increasing fiber volume fraction and increased with increasing load. The coefficients of friction of the composites were higher than that of the unreinforced matrix alloy. The modeling results confirm the feasibility of the ANN and its good correlation with the experimental results. The degrees of accuracy of the prediction were 94.2 and 99.4% for specific wear rate and friction coefficient, respectively. It is concluded that ANN is an excellent analytical tool if it is well trained. This means considerable cost and time saving. Finally, using ANN modeling data and experimental data, 3D plots and empirical expressions for specific wear rate and friction coefficient related to load and fiber volume fraction were established. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These additives improve the tribological properties and help to reduce friction, wear, and corrosion. This review explored differ-ent water-based lubricant additives and summarized their properties and performances. Viscosity, density, wettability, and solubility are discussed to determine the viability of using water-based nano-lubricants compared to petroleum-based lubricants for reducing friction and wear in machin-ing. Water-based liquid lubricants also have environmental benefits over petroleum-based lubri-cants. Further research is needed to understand and optimize water-based lubrication for tribolog-ical systems completely.},

From the theoretical results it was found that in high speed, mist-lubricated ball bearings, the reduction factor of the film thickness by starvation and thermal effects can be computed in correlation with the ball-race lateral oil meniscus thicknesses. Experimental investigations of 7206 C angular contact ball bearings, operating between 5000 and 35 000 min-1, are in good correlation with the theoretical results when only starvation and inlet shear heating have been included. When the ball bearing temperature increases, both the theoretical and experimental results show that starvation occurs at smaller ball-race lateral oil meniscus thicknesses, by decreasing the oil viscosity. © 1993.},

   abstract = {A method is presented for calculating and analyzing the quasi-static load distribution and varying stiffness of a radially loaded double row bearing with a raceway defect of varying depth, length, and surface roughness. The method is applied to ball bearings on gearbox and fan test rigs seeded with line or extended outer raceway defects. When balls pass through the defect and lose all or part of their load carrying capacity, the load is redistributed between the loaded balls. This includes balls positioned outside the defect such that good raceway sections are subjected to increased loading when a defect is present. The defective bearing stiffness varies periodically at the ball spacing, and only differs from the good bearing case when balls are positioned in the defect. In this instance, the stiffness decreases in the loaded direction and increases in the unloaded direction. For an extended spall, which always has one or more balls positioned in the defect, this results in an average stiffness over the ball spacing period that is lower in the loaded direction in comparison to both the line spall and good bearing cases. The variation in bearing stiffness due to the defect produces parametric excitations of the bearing assembly. The qualitative character of the vibration response correlates to the character of the stiffness variations. Rapid stiffness changes at a defect exit produce impulses. Slower stiffness variations due to large wavelength waviness features in an extended spall produce low frequency excitation which results in defect components in the velocity spectra. The contact forces fluctuate around the quasi-static loads on the balls, with rapid stiffness changes producing high magnitude impulsive force fluctuations. Furthermore, it is shown that analyzing the properties of the dynamic model linearized at the quasi-static solutions provides greater insight into the time-frequency characteristics of the vibration response. This is demonstrated by relating the low frequency event that occurs when a ball enters a line spall to the dynamic properties of the bearing assembly. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a simulation model for a gearbox test rig, in which a range of bearing faults can be implemented. Bearing faults sometimes manifest themselves by their interaction with meshing gears, and to simulate this it is necessary to model a whole system of gears and shafts supported in bearings. This has now been done for an experimental test rig through the incorporation of a time-varying, non-linear stiffness bearing model into a previously developed gear model. The incorporated bearing model is based on Hertzian contact theory, which relates the raceway displacement to the bearing load, and also accounts for the slippage between the elements. It has the capacity to model localised spalls (inner race, outer race and rolling elements), which are discussed in this part of the paper and extended inner and outer race faults (rough surfaces), which are discussed in part II. Even though the whole gearbox has not been modelled in detail, the non-linear time-varying gear-meshing operation is modelled in some detail. Both simulated and experimental localised fault signals (acceleration signals) were subjected to the same diagnostic techniques; namely spectrum comparisons, Spectral Kurtosis (SK) analysis and envelope analysis. The processed simulated signals showed a similar pattern to that observed in their measured counterparts and were found to have a characteristic, referred to in the literature as double pulses, corresponding to entry into and exit from the localised fault. The simulation model will be useful for producing typical fault signals from gearboxes to test new diagnostic algorithms, and possibly prognostic algorithms. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The shape of the elastically flattened contact regions on the rollers appeared to change with rolling speed in such a way as to explain why ball bearings and gears have longer fatigue life (in revolutions) at high speed than at low speed. The experimental results are compared with lubrication theory in which the elastic deflections of the bearing surfaces are combined with the viscous flow of the lubricant under pressure.

By varying a control parameter, different routes to chaos are described. The most widely known is the subharmonic route, which is characterized by an increasing number of subharmonics of the driving frequency. Alternance of period doubling and tripling has been noticed, as the ball pass frequency is around the first resonance of the bearing. The second route is a quasi-periodic route. It is characterized by competition between the second resonance of the bearing and the ball pass frequency. It results in an increasing number of combinations of two incommensurate frequencies. During the quasi-periodic sequence, mode-locking occurs each time the two frequencies are locally commensurate. The last type of chaos that is observed is involved by the quasi-periodic breakdown of an attractor. It looks like intermittency and, in the present case, it is obtained by introduction of some over-sized balls. Finally, the occurrence of loss of contact between balls and raceways is studied and related to the existence of chaos. © 1993 1993 Academic Press Limited.},

Thus, plain bearings are widely used, which are characterized by a non-linear forcedisplacement transfer function especially at low rotational speed. To meet the requirements, combined roller and plain bearings were developed and investigated. Control of forming processes demands for continuous behavior as well as high machine stiffness.

The HAFB direct stiffness coefficients measured from both methods are close to each other in the range of 47 MN/m depending on speed, load, and supply pressure, but frequency domain method shows larger scatter in the identified coefficients. HAFB coefficients simulated with the linear perturbation method using a bump stiffness matched to the load-deflection characteristics at 18,000 rpm show reasonably good agreements with experimentally measured values.

The amount of air in the lubricant is varied from nil to 100 percent to simulate increasing degrees of severity of air entrainment into the damper film lands. The experimental results and parameter estimation technique show that the SFD damping force coefficients increase as the air volume fraction in the mixture increases to about 50 percent in volume content. The damping coefficients decrease rapidly for mixtures with larger air concentrations. The unexpected increase in direct damping coefficients indicates the complexity of the SFD bubbly flow field and warrants further experimental verification. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

In many instances the vital data may be obtained from theory which must be confirmed by experimental measurement beforehand, or alternatively the data may be obtained directly from experimental measurement when the appropriate bearing has already been manufactured. The experimental techniques available for use in the measurement of M. J. Goodwin bearing impedances are varied, both in their experimental procedure and in the Staffordshire Polytechnic, theoretical treatment of the data that is gathered. Theaim of this paper is to provide Beaconside, Stafford, England a concise account of these techniques, and to discuss the potential advantages and disadvantages of each approach. In this document, the procedures described are classified in terms of the type of experimental measuring equipment required. These vary from the simplest of test rigs, which provide only a static load in one direction and where impedances can be evaluated by hand calculation, to sophisticated apparatus capable of providing static and dynamic loads in several directions and which require computer software to extract the bearing impedances from the measured data. The type of experimental procedure selected by the rotor dynamicist will depend upon the experimental facilities available, on the time available to carry out the testing, and on the required reliability of results. Each of these considerations is discussed for each procedure described. It is concluded that measurements made using multifrequency test signals provide more reliable data, although all measurement methods yield coefficient values which agree with theoretical predictions to within about 20 percent in general, and all methods have a significant scatter of results associated with their use. © 1991 by ASME.},

   abstract = {Brush seals effectively control leakage in air breathing engines, albeit only applied for relatively low-pressure differentials. Hybrid brush seals (HBS) are an alternative to resolve poor reliability resulting from bristle tip wear while also allowing for reverse shaft rotation operations. A HBS incorporates pads contacting the shaft on assembly; and which under rotor spinning, lift off due to the generation of a hydrodynamic pressure. The ensuing gas film prevents intermittent contact, reducing wear, and thermal distortions. This paper presents rotordynamic measurements conducted on a test rig for evaluation of HBS technology. Single frequency shaker loads are exerted on a test rotor holding a hybrid brush seal, and measurements of rotor displacements follow for operating conditions with increasing gas supply pressures and two rotor speeds. A frequency domain identification method delivers the test system stiffness and damping coefficients. The HBS stiffness coefficients are not affected by rotor speed though the seal viscous damping shows a strong frequency dependency. The identified HBS direct stiffness decreases ~15% as the supply/discharge pressure increases Pr=1.7-2.4. The HBS cross-coupled stiffnesses are insignificant, at least one order of magnitude smaller than the direct stiffnesses. A structural loss factor (γ) and dry-friction coefficient (μ) represent the energy dissipated in a HBS by the bristle-to-bristle and bristle-to-pad interactions. Predictions of HBS stiffness and damping coefficients correlate well with the test derived parameters. Both model predictions and test results show the dramatic reduction in the seal equivalent viscous damping coefficients as the excitation whirl frequency increases. © 2010 by ASME.},

For this purpose, we use data from EHL simulations based upon the full-system finite element (FE) solution and a Latin hypercube sampling. We verify that the original input data are required to train ML approaches to achieve coefficients of determination above 0.99. It is revealed that the architecture of artificial neural networks (neurons per layer and number of hidden layers) and activation functions influence the prediction accuracy. The impact of the number of training data is exemplified, and recommendations for a minimum database size are given. We ultimately demonstrate that artificial neural networks can predict the locally-resolved film thickness values over the contact domain 25-times faster than FE-based EHL simulations ( R 2 values above 0.999). We assume that this will boost the use of ML approaches to predict EHL parameters and traction losses in multibody system dynamics simulations.},

   abstract = {Besides various other application fields, flexible multi-body dynamics simulation is used in particular during the development process of internal combustion engines and power units. Problems such as crankshaft and engine dynamics, radial slider bearing dynamics or noise, vibration, and harshness can be investigated using this methodology. Any specific engine component, called body, can be represented by different methods. Besides beam-mass representations and structured modelling, finite element models are commonly used. As these imply a large number of degrees of freedom, they cannot be applied directly to multi-body dynamics ensuring computational performance. Therefore, condensation methods need to be applied which result in a reduced model with equivalent dynamical properties. This is particularly important if detailed, highly non-linear contact dynamic models, for instance the well-known Reynolds equation, are considered. Typically, condensation methods are applied to structural matrices of bodies which perform only vibration motions without any global motions. This study outlines a floating frame of reference formulation for condensed components, which perform global motions in addition to the vibration motions. For this purpose, non-linear inertia terms of the reduced body, which result from the global motions need to be computed considering the applied reduction strategy. Both the theoretical background of the formulation and some application examples of the method will be discussed. Copyright © 2011 by Institution of Mechanical Engineers.},

   abstract = {This work presents a methodology for including the Elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film effects to a lateral vibration model of a deep groove ball bearing by using a novel approximation for the EHD contacts by a set of equivalent nonlinear spring and viscous damper. The fitting of the equivalent contact model used the results of a transient multi-level finite difference EHD algorithm to adjust the dynamic parameters. The comparison between the approximated model and the finite difference simulated results showed a suitable representation of the stationary and dynamic contact behaviors. The linear damping hypothesis could be shown as a rough representation of the actual hysteretic behavior of the EHD contact. Nevertheless, the overall accuracy of the model was not impaired by the use of such approximation. Further on, the inclusion of the equivalent EHD contact model is equated for both the restoring and the dissipative components of the bearing's lateral dynamics. The derived model was used to investigate the effects of the rolling element bearing lubrication on the vibration response of a rotor's lumped parameter model. The fluid film stiffening effect, previously only observable by experimentation, could be quantified using the proposed model, as well as the portion of the bearing damping provided by the EHD fluid film. Results from a laboratory rotor-bearing test rig were used to indirectly validate the proposed contact approximation. A finite element model of the rotor accounting for the lubricated bearing formulation adequately portrayed the frequency content of the bearing orbits observed on the test rig.},

   abstract = {An elastohydrodynamic lubrication line contact-vibration model is proposed to study the stiffness and damping of the oil film existed in the EHL contact region. An initial mutual approach between interacting surfaces, which deviates from the steady-state balanced position, is assumed under the free contact-vibration to predict the response of the mutual approach. An inertia term, which represents the acceleration of the gap motion, is added to the classical force balance equation to form the equation of motion of the mutual approach. Response of the mutual approach is solved based upon the solving of the contact-dynamic model. The oil stiffness is calculated according to the natural frequency of the response under damped and non-damped conditions, the latter of which represents dry contact conditions. The oil film damping is calculated in terms of the principle of the energy conservation which utilizes the whole history of response compared with the log decrement method. Effect of the normal load, the rolling speed and the amplitude of the regular sinusoidal surface waviness on the oil film stiffness, the contact stiffness and the oil film damping are studied. The study provides an insight on the oil film dynamic characteristics of lubricated contact-vibration problems which appear in gears, bearings, etc. The results show that the oil film damping factor decreases with the increasing normal load as well as the increasing rolling speed. The oil film stiffness increases with the normal load and decreases with the rolling speed. Also, compared to the contact stiffness, the oil film stiffness makes less contribution to the total stiffness. The surface waviness amplitude has little effect on the oil film stiffness and the oil film damping.},

The dynamics of the bearing is governed by both the dynamics of its structural elements, i.e., the inner ring, the outer ring and the rolling elements, and the elastohydrodynamic lubricated (EHL) contacts connecting these structural elements. To investigate the eect of the lubricant on the dynamic behaviour of deep groove ball bearings, computational models have been developed for both the EHL problem and the structural dynamics problem. In the present study, the interaction between the structural elements is described by means of a non-linear spring-damper model which is based on numerical solutions of the full EHL contact problem. These relations have subsequently been adopted in the structural dynamics bearing model. Using these models, the shift of bearing eigenfrequencies as a result of lubrication is investigated and modal damping values for the preloaded bearing are estimated. It is suggested that the shift of the eigenfrequencies is mainly caused by contact angle variations.},

The experimental setup allows investigation of the load–displacement behavior of a four-point contact ball bearing submitted to a static thrust loading. Displacements are measured by an optical method (stereo-correlation) that enables comparison of the surface deformation of the two tested bearings and computation of the rigid-body displacement of the inner ring with respect to the outer ring. A comparison between experimental results, numerical results, with and without consideration of ring and housing stiffness, is presented. The numerical results show the importance of the housing stiffness in the modeling, even with standard ball bearings with relatively large and thick rings.

   abstract = {Conventional calculations of ball and roller bearing carrying capacity and fatigue life assume that the raceway bodies are rigid structures and that all elastic deformation occurs at the rolling elements' contact with the raceways. In many instances, and particularly with aircraft applications, the bearing rings and their supports cannot be considered rigid. One such application is the planet gear in a transmission. This report develops a theory whereby the effects of the elastic distortions of the outer race of a rolling-element bearing on the internal load distribution and fatigue life of the bearing can be considered. The theory has been programmed for a high-speed, digital computer. An example of calculation for a planet gear roller bearing whose outer race is integral with the gear and of relatively thin section is given. The distortions of the flexible outer ring cause a significantly lower bearing fatigue life (Lw) than would occur if the outer ring were rigid and considering a practical range of bearing diametral clearances. Mr. Jones developed the theoretical analysis for this paper and Mr. Harris provided the programming and the experimental data. Theoretical Development FIG. 1 illustrates an idler gear such as is used in a planetary transmission. The gear may be bored out and act directly as the outer race of a rolling-element bearing or it may be press-fitted over a conventional bearing outer ring. In many instances, and in particular with aircraft transmissions , the outer race of the rolling-element bearing undergoes distortions due to the application of the gear tooth load. The inner race is generally a much stiffer structure and its distortions under load are neglected in this derivation. Distortions of the inner-race structure will tend to relieve the peak rolling-element loads. Thus the maximum reduction in bearing life will result from the neglect of inner-race structure distortion. The normal tooth loads in Fig. 1 may be resolved into radial and tangential components. Fig. 2 shows the components of load acting at the centroid of the equivalent outer-ring section. The ring is held in equilibrium by the rolling-element loads.},

   abstract = {In many applications, such as four-point contact slewing bearings or main shaft angular contact ball bearings, the rings and housings are so thin that the assumption of rigid rings does not hold anymore. In this paper, several methods are proposed to account for the flexibility of rings in a quasi-static ball bearing numerical model. The modeling approach consists of coupling a semianalytical approach and a finite element (FE) model to describe the deformation of the rings and housings. The manner in which this weak coupling is made differs depending on how the structural deformation of the ring and housing assemblies is injected into the set of nonlinear geometrical and equilibrium equations in order to solve them. These methods enable us to account for ring ovalization, ring twist, and raceway opening (including change of conformity) since a tulip deformation mode of the ring groove is observed for high contact angles. Either the torus fitting technique or mean displacement computation are used to determine these geometrical parameters. A comparison between the different approaches allows us to study, in particular, the impact of raceway conformity change. The loads used in this investigation are chosen in order that the maximum contact pressure (the Hertz pressure) at the ballraceway interface remains below 2000 MPa, without any contact ellipse truncation. For the ball bearing example considered here, relative differences of up to 30% on the axial displacement, 10% on the maximum contact pressure, and 10% on the contact angle are observed by comparing rigid and deformable rings for a typical loading representative of the one encountered in operation. Despite the local change of conformity, which becomes significant at high contact angles and for thin ball bearing flanges, it is shown that this hardly affects the internal load distribution. The paper ends with a discussion on how the ring and housing flexibility may affect the loading envelope when the truncation of the contact ellipse is an issue. Copyright ©2013 by ASME.},

It may cause significant changes in dynamics characteristics, bearing deflections, contact stresses, and fatigue endurance, especially under heavy applied load, large size bearing, hollowed shaft and nonrigid bearing housing. The purpose in the work presented is to research a new approach and multibody model of bearing rings for MBS of mechanical system with rolling bearings. The flexibility and three-dimensional multibody model of bearing rings have been developed using equivalent rigid elements and curved Timoshenko beam elements. The simulation of the bearing rings vibration response will be presented. In addition to the presented multibody model, the FEM model and analytical model are also used to perform the vibration analyses of the bearing ring. An investigation of the actual static deformation field of the outer ring loaded by 5 balls has been carried out for the radial displacement field using the presented model. The total number of the discrete equivalent rigid elements and CTB elements has an important effect on the predicted frequencies, however the results will be minimal changes when the elements are achieved a certain number. In such situations, the presented approach can provide multibody rings model for contact dynamics of rolling bearings with acceptable accuracy and considerably less computational effort. The calculated radial static deformation is critical to load distribution, life fatigue and dynamics characteristics of rolling bearings. The three-dimensional multibody model of bearing rings developed here and the predicted frequencies agree well with the analytical results and FEM. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Structural deformations of the rings are included in the geometrical equations linking the relative displacements between rings. The Newmark type implicit integration technique coupled with the Newton-Raphson method is used to solve the differential equation system iteratively. Time displacements and theirs FFT are used to illustrate and elucidate the diversity of the system response. Computations performed when considering the structural deformations of the rings show a low frequency shift, as higher harmonics are attenuated while the first are more pronounced. With an unbalanced rotor, the ball pass frequency (BPF) is modulated with this perturbation leading to an aperiodic response. This is particularly true for the counter-rotating bearing investigated. Finally, results for different cage materials show a significant influence only on the cage center location, whereas the inertia moment of the cage is of little impact on the global dynamics behavior. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {With the continuous demand to squeeze more performance from critical engine components such as crankshaft bearings, design analysis and calculations methods are also required to become more comprehensive. With the advent of Elasto Hydrodynamic Lubrication (EHL) methods, for example, designers could investigate theoretically the effects of housing geometry or stiffness on bearing performance; which was previously not possible with rigid bearing (mobility method) calculations. Traditional methods for EHL analyses of crankshaft bearings normally incorporate the elasticity of the connecting rod or housing but assume that the crankpin is rigid. This paper demonstrates the effects of including the flexibility of the crankshaft journal (up to the adjacent main bearing) for three examples of connecting rod bearings. The examples cover a typical Formula 1 (F1) racing engine at 16000rpm, an automotive gasoline engine at 5500rpm and a 120mm journal diameter diesel engine at 2000rpm.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a novel semi-analytical bearing model addressing flexibility of the bearing outer race structure. It furthermore presents the application of this model in a bearing load condition monitoring approach. The bearing model is developed as current computational low cost bearing models fail to provide an accurate description of the more and more common flexible size and weight optimized bearing designs due to their assumptions of rigidity. In the proposed bearing model raceway flexibility is described by the use of static deformation shapes. The excitation of the deformation shapes is calculated based on the modelled rolling element loads and a Fourier series based compliance approximation. The resulting model is computational low cost and provides an accurate description of the rolling element loads for flexible outer raceway structures. The latter is validated by a simulation-based comparison study with a well-established bearing simulation software tool. An experimental study finally shows the potential of the proposed model in a bearing load monitoring approach.},

   abstract = {For high-precision mechanisms such as machine tools or gas-turbine engines, which operate at extreme conditions, it is particularly important to accurately predict the behavior of the included bearing. This prediction includes, among other things, its load distribution, stiffness, and power dissipation. Although shaft speeds tend to increase, rings and shaft walls are becoming thinner due to size and weight constraints. Thus, bearing behavior is no longer independent of the housing and ring stiffness. This paper focuses on the problem of elastic ring deformation and certain behaviors of high-speed intershaft cylindrical roller bearings such as heat dissipation, contact pressure, and risk of bearing failure due to scuffing. The paper presents an analytical method to account for the structural deformation of the rings based on Roark's formulas. The elastic deformation of thin cylindrical rings has been introduced in the set of displacement and load equations that describes the bearing equilibrium. A correlation with a high-speed intershaft cylindrical roller bearing application is made and the results are compared with those obtained with the finite element method for housing deformations. Heat dissipation, load distribution, contact pressure, and internal kinematics are discussed to evaluate co-rotating and contrarotating shaft design solutions.

A clear understanding of the influences of the bearing geometries on the dynamic performances is very helpful for vibration control of the machinery system. A dynamic finite element model of a roller bearing is presented. The influence of the raceway thickness of the outer race on the component stress, contact forces, and vibrations of the roller bearing is studied, which has not yet been investigated in previous work. All components of the roller bearing are modeled as elastic bodies. The waveforms of the contact force and the acceleration of the bearings considering different thickness percentages are compared, as well as the acceleration statistics and component stresses. The simulation results show that the raceway thickness of the outer race has a great influence on the stress, the contact force, and the vibrations of the bearing. It seems that an outer race with a suitable raceway thickness can be useful for decreasing the contact force and vibrations of the roller bearings. The presented results can give some guidance for the roller bearing design and geometry optimization.},

In this model, the structure deformations of the roller and races caused by the centrifugal forces and external loads are formulated, as well as the shaft and housing deformation.

Real load distribution is between these boundary cases.

   abstract = {Ball bearings are an integral part of many machines and mechanisms and often determine their performance limits. Vibration, friction and power loss are some of the key measures of bearing performance. Therefore, there have been many predictive analyses of bearing performance with emphasis on various aspects. The current study presents a mathematical model, incorporating bearing dynamics, mechanics of rolling element-to-races contacts as well as the elastodynamics of the bearing outer ring as a focus of the study. It is shown that the bearing power loss in cage cycles increases by as much as 4% when the flexibility of the outer ring is taken into account as a thick elastic ring, based on Timoshenko beam theory as opposed to the usual assumption of a rigid ring in other studies. Geometric optimisation has shown that the lifetime power consumption can be reduced by 1.25%, which is a significant source of energy saving when considering the abundance of machines using rolling element bearings. The elastodynamics of bearing rings significantly affects the radial bearing clearance through increased roller loads and generated contact pressures. The flexible ring dynamics is shown to generate surface waviness through global elastic wave propagation, not hitherto taken into account in contact dynamics of rollers-to-raceways which are generally considered to be subjected to only localised Hertzian deflection. The elastodynamic behaviour reduces the elastohydrodynamic film thickness, affecting contact friction, wear, fatigue, vibration, noise and inefficiency.},

The diametral clearance is found to have a significant effect on the level of vibration as well as on the natural frequencies. Low-order waviness, also known as out-of-roundness, is found to generate vibration at frequencies of the waviness order multiplied by the rotation speed. On the other hand, the waviness orders close to the number of balls in the bearing (z± 1 and z) are found to generate vibrations at the ball passage inner ring and ball passage outer ring frequencies. Various excitations produce sum and difference frequencies. Localized defects in the inner and outer ring are found to generate vibrations at bearing defect frequencies.

To eliminate unnecessary effects caused by bearing setting and preloading, the single-bearing is specially fabricated to unite its inner ring and a shaft in one body, and also its outer ring and a rotor. This structure enables to be preloaded by an externally pressurized air bearing. Experimental damping ratios are found to range from 2-4%, and damping coefficients from 0.15-0.35 Ns/mm. Damping is found to decrease with increasing preload, and to be larger for larger clearance and for larger ball number. Decreases in damping owing to superimpose of the inclined mode and owing to increase in clearance lead to the fact that ball rolling motion rather than sliding motion is apt to decrease damping. Also, bearing rotational effect is found to be small, and grease hardly provides damping function during rotation. © 1992, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {<p>The present paper discussed the development of a reliable and robust artificial neural network (ANN) capable of predicting the tribological performance of three highly alloyed tool steel grades. Experimental results were obtained by performing plane-contact sliding tests under non-lubrication conditions on a pin-on-disk tribometer. The specimens were tested both in untreated state with different hardening levels, and after surface treatment of nitrocarburizing. We concluded that wear maps via ANN modeling were a user-friendly approach for the presentation of wear-related information, since they easily permitted the determination of areas under steady-state wear that were appropriate for use. Furthermore, the achieved optimum ANN model seemed to be a simple and helpful design/educational tool, which could assist both in educational seminars, as well as in the interpretation of the surface treatment effects on the tribological performance of tool steels.</p>},

Flank wear in drill depends upon speed, feed rate, drill diameter and hence these parameters along with other derived parameters such as thrust force, torque and vibration have been used to predict flank wear using ANN. Effect of using increasing number of sensors in the efficacy of predicting drill wear by using ANN has been studied. It has been observed that inclusion of vibration signal along with thrust force and torque leads to better prediction of drill wear. The results obtained from the two different ANN architectures have been compared and some useful conclusions have been made. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {<p> Non-dimensional similarity groups and analytically solvable proximity equations can be used to estimate integral fluid film parameters of elastohydrodynamically lubricated (EHL) contacts. In this contribution, we demonstrate that machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches (support vector machines, Gaussian process regressions, and artificial neural networks) can predict relevant film parameters more efficiently and with higher accuracy and flexibility compared to sophisticated EHL simulations and analytically solvable proximity equations, respectively. For this purpose, we use data from EHL simulations based upon the full-system finite element (FE) solution and a Latin hypercube sampling. We verify that the original input data are required to train ML approaches to achieve coefficients of determination above 0.99. It is revealed that the architecture of artificial neural networks (neurons per layer and number of hidden layers) and activation functions influence the prediction accuracy. The impact of the number of training data is exemplified, and recommendations for a minimum database size are given. We ultimately demonstrate that artificial neural networks can predict the locally-resolved film thickness values over the contact domain 25-times faster than FE-based EHL simulations ( <italic>R</italic> <sup>2</sup> values above 0.999). We assume that this will boost the use of ML approaches to predict EHL parameters and traction losses in multibody system dynamics simulations. </p>},

The output from the test, friction coefficient versus entrainment speed and slide-to-roll ratio (SRR), is presented as a three-dimensional friction map. A number of parameters are varied while studying the friction coefficient; surface roughness, base oil viscosity, base oil type, and extreme pressure (EP) additive package. Entrainment speed, SRR, and oil temperature are also varied. The results show that the mapping is efficient in showing the different types of friction that may occur in an elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication contact. The results also show that the friction behaviour can be strongly influenced by changing surface roughness as well as base oil viscosity, base oil type, EP additive content, and operating temperature.</p>},

Published research extends across many fields of tribology from composite materials and drive technology to manufacturing, surface engineering, and lubricants. Accordingly, the intended usages and numerical algorithms are manifold, ranging from artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees over random forest and rule-based learners to support vector machines.

   abstract = {Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the well-known learning algorithms for classification and regression problems. SVM parameters such as kernel parameters and penalty parameter have a great influence on the complexity and performance of predicting models. Hence, the model selection in SVM involves the penalty parameter and kernel parameters. However, these parameters are usually selected and used as a black box, without understanding the internal details. In this paper, the behavior of the SVM classifier is analyzed when these parameters take different values. This analysis consists of illustrative examples, visualization, and mathematical and geometrical interpretations with the aim of providing the basics of kernel functions with SVM and to show how it works to serve as a comprehensive source for researchers who are interested in this field. This paper starts by highlighting the definition and underlying principles of SVM in details. Moreover, different kernel functions are introduced and the impact of each parameter in these kernel functions is explained from different perspectives.},

   abstract = {Recently, support vector machines (SVMs) have proven to have great potential for classification of remotely sensed hyperspectral data acquired in a large number of spectral bands. Due to Hughes' phenomenon, conventional parametric classifiers fail to classify such a high dimensional dataset. In the past, neural networks and decision tree classifiers, which are nonparametric in nature, have frequently been used for classification of multispectral remote sensing data. These, however, have marked limitations when applied to hyperspectral data. In this paper, we present the results of applying SVMs for a 16-class classification of an AVIRIS image and compare its performance with decision tree, back propagation (BP) and radial basis function (RBF) neural network classifiers. There are a number of parameters that may affect the accuracy of SVM based classifiers. The best values of these parameters have been selected on the basis of a set of hypotheses and experiments. All the SVM classifications have been performed using an in-house code developed in a Matlab environment. The Kappa coefficient of agreement has been used to assess the accuracy of classification. The differences in classification accuracy have been statistically evaluated using a pairwise Z-test. SVM classification using a polynomial kernel of degree 2 produced an accuracy of 96.94% whereas the accuracies achieved by decision tree, BP and RBF neural network classifiers were 74.75%, 38.03% and 95.30% respectively. This clearly illustrates that the accuracy of the SVM classifier is significantly higher than decision tree and BP neural network classifiers at 95% confidence level. Although, the improvement in SVM classification accuracy with respect to the RBF neural network classifier was not statistically significant, the SVM classifier was more computationally efficient than the RBF classifier for hyperspectral image classification.},

Listed soft computing techniques give opportunities to researchers working on non-linear problems. Based on the non-linear approach, models are generated by using precipitation, flow, temperature hydrological parameters. The models were compared with each other according to the three statistical criteria, namely, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and determination coefficient. As a result of the study, it is seen that Support Vector Machines (SVM) models have better performance in predicting dam reservoir level than the other used soft computing models.},

The analysis was carried out in such a manner that different efficient alternatives are presented. In this paper, a possible decision-making strategy was explored and implemented to plan and design technologies for the stages of collection, transport and final disposal of waste in cities, while taking into account their particular characteristics. The first model used to analyze data was the decision tree which employed machine learning as a non-parametric algorithm that models data separation limitations based on the learning decision rules on the input characteristics of the model. Support vector machines were the second method implemented as a forecasting model. The primary advantage of support vector machines is their proper adjustment to data despite its variable nature or when faced with problems with a small amount of training data. Lastly, recurrent neural network models to forecast data were implemented, which yielded positive results. Their architectural design is useful in exploring temporal correlations among the same. Distribution by collection zone in the city, socio-economic stratification, population, and quantity of solid waste generated in a determined period of time were factors considered in the analysis of this forecast. The results found that support vector machines are the most appropriate model for this type of analysis.},

As a result, many scientists study the phenomenon, and some of them have focused on producing landslide susceptibility maps that can be used by land-use managers to reduce injury and damage. This paper contributes to this effort by comparing the power and effectiveness of five machine learning, benchmark algorithms—Logistic Model Tree, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes Tree, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine—in creating a reliable shallow landslide susceptibility map for Bijar City in Kurdistan province, Iran. Twenty conditioning factors were applied to 111 shallow landslides and tested using the One-R attribute evaluation (ORAE) technique for modeling and validation processes. The performance of the models was assessed by statistical-based indexes including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operatic characteristic curve (AUC). Results indicate that all the five machine learning models performed well for shallow landslide susceptibility assessment, but the Logistic Model Tree model (AUC = 0.932) had the highest goodness-of-fit and prediction accuracy, followed by the Logistic Regression (AUC = 0.932), Naïve Bayes Tree (AUC = 0.864), ANN (AUC = 0.860), and Support Vector Machine (AUC = 0.834) models. Therefore, we recommend the use of the Logistic Model Tree model in shallow landslide mapping programs in semi-arid regions to help decision makers, planners, land-use managers, and government agencies mitigate the hazard and risk.},

The effect of feature numbers was examined using the recommended parameters of the ANN, SVM, and GPR models. It was concluded that using speed, manifold absolute pressure, and air fuel ratio as input parameters to build the prediction model performed best. The generalization ability of the three ML models was compared on the interpolative and extrapolative data sets using the extended recommendation parameters. The results showed that the GPR model performed the best generalization ability in scarce data sets and was simpler to train compared with ANN and SVM. The response surfaces constructed using the GPR model were very smooth and accurate, in which the coefficient of determination for all the predicted parameters was more than 0.99. It is strongly proposed that the GPR approach is a universal approach which will be an essential direction for WRE system control and surrogate model modeling.},

   abstract = {The purpose of current research was to implement an intelligent regression model and multi-objective optimization of performance, combustion and emissions characteristics for a hydrogen-enriched gasoline rotary engine. The brake thermal efficiency (BTE), fuel energy flow rate (Ef), nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) were predicted by intelligent regression model with hydrogen volume fraction (αH2), excess air ratio (λ) and ignition timing (IT) as independent variables. The intelligent regression models were based on support vector machine (SVM) and optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the optimal parameters of the regression model. The data for training the SVM model were derived from the experimental results of a hydrogen-enriched rotary engine, in which the speed was kept constant at 4500 r/min, the absolute manifold pressure remained at 35 KPa, the variation of αH2, λ and IT were 0–6%, 1–1.3 and 24–42 °CA before top dead center (bTDC), respectively. After optimized by GA, the coefficient of determination of BTE, Ef, NOX, CO and HC between the SVM model and the corresponding data were greater than 0.98, and the mean absolute percentage error were <1%. The performance, combustion, and emissions characteristics including BTE, Ef, NOX, CO and HC were considered for multi-objective optimization to obtain higher performance and lower emissions, and were solved using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II. For this study, when the Pareto-optimal solutions were obtained, the optimal operating parameters were further obtained by limiting the performance and emissions parameters with the αH2 of 5.06%, λ of 1.09%, and IT of 34.27 °CA bTDC.},

   abstract = {A Machine Learning-Genetic Algorithm (ML-GA) approach was developed to virtually discover optimum designs using training data generated from multi-dimensional simulations. Machine learning (ML) presents a pathway to transform complex physical processes that occur in a combustion engine into compact informational processes. In the present work, a total of over 2000 sector-mesh computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of a heavy-duty engine were performed. These were run concurrently on a supercomputer to reduce overall turnaround time. The engine being optimized was run on a low-octane (RON70) gasoline fuel under partially premixed compression ignition (PPCI) mode. A total of nine input parameters were varied, and the CFD simulation cases were generated by randomly sampling points from this nine-dimensional input space. These input parameters included fuel injection strategy, injector design, and various in-cylinder flow and thermodynamic conditions at intake valve closure (IVC). The outputs (targets) of interest from these simulations included five metrics related to engine performance and emissions. Over 2000 samples generated from CFD were then used to train an ML model that could predict these five targets based on the nine input features. A robust super learner approach was employed to build the ML model, where results from a collection of different ML algorithms were pooled together. Thereafter, a stochastic global optimization genetic algorithm (GA) was used, with the ML model as the objective function, to optimize the input parameters based on a merit function so as to minimize fuel consumption while satisfying CO and NO x emissions constraints. The optimized configuration from ML-GA was found to be very close to that obtained from a sequentially performed CFD-GA approach, where a CFD simulation served as the objective function. In addition, the overall turnaround time was (at least) 75% lower with the ML-GA approach, as the training data was generated from concurrent CFD simulations and employing the ML model as the objective function significantly accelerated the GA optimization. This study demonstrates the potential of ML-GA and high-performance computing (HPC) to reduce the number of CFD simulations to be performed for optimization problems without loss in accuracy, thereby providing significant cost savings compared to traditional approaches.},
